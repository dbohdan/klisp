1 Introduction
**************

klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
Language.  It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
the `Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language', but that
probably won't happen for some time.  It is written in C99 under the
MIT license.  It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source code &
file structure.  It uses the IMath library for arbitrary sized integers
and rationals.

   The Kernel programming language is a statically scoped and properly
tail-recursive dialect of Lisp, descended from Scheme.  It is designed
to be simpler and more general than Scheme, with an exceptionally
clear, simple, and versatile semantics, only one way to form compound
expressions, and no inessential restrictions on the power of that one
compound form.  Imperative, functional, and message-passing programming
styles (to name a few) may be conveniently expressed in Kernel.

   An important property of Kernel is that all manipulable entities in
Kernel are first-class objects.  In particular, Kernel has no
second-class combiners; instead, the roles of special forms and macros
are subsumed by operatives, which are first-class, statically scoped
combiners that act directly on their unevaluated operands.  Kernel also
has a second type of combiners, applicatives, which act on their evalu-
ated arguments.  Applicatives are roughly equivalent to Scheme
procedures.  However, an applicative is nothing more than a wrapper to
induce operand evaluation, around an underlying operative (or, in
principle, around another applicative, though that isn’t usually done);
applicatives themselves are mere facilitators to computation.

   This manual describes klisp version 0.1, presuming some familiarity
with the Lisp family of languages in general, and with the Kernel
Programming Language in particular.  There are frequent references to
the Kernel Programming Language Report.  Unlike in the report, no
rationale is provided for any feature, only a description of the
implemented functionality.

   This is edition 0.1.

1.1 Caveats
===========

This is the first draft of this manual.  It will be incomplete for some
time.  It will also evolve, together with klisp and the Kernel
Programming Language, both of which, right now, are in a quite fluid
state.

   The main reference on Kernel is the preliminary report: `Revised(-1)
Report on the Kernel Programming Language'.  Some sections of the
report are still incomplete, so both klisp and this manual will use
specifications from other languages in these sections, trying to follow
the Kernel spirit.  These instances will be documented throughout the
manual.

   Please mail comments and corrections to <canavarro82@gmail.com>.

1.2 Kernel History
==================

The Kernel Programming Language is a work in progress.  It is being
developed by John N. Shutt, Ph.D, who created it while studying at the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (I think about 2002, or so... ASK).  It
is descended from scheme, with the idea that all objects should be
first class values.  In particular, Kernel replaces macros with
operatives (kinda like statically scoped fexprs and fsubrs) and has
first class environments.  Kernel also has the notion of encapsulated
objects which limits the ammount of information an implementation can
share with a Kernel program (e.g. There is no way in Kernel to get the
parents or a complete list of bindings of an environment object).

   The main reference on Kernel is the preliminary report: `Revised(-1)
Report on the Kernel Programming Language'.  Some sections of the
report are still incomplete, so both klisp and this manual will use
specifications from other languages in these sections, trying to follow
the Kernel spirit.  These instances will be documented throughout the
manual.

   You can read all about Kernel at John's homepage at WPI
`http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/', including the preliminary report on
the language and his doctoral dissertation which gives a theorethical
frame for fexprs.  You can contact him at <jshutt@cs.wpi.edu>.

1.3 Conventions
===============

This section explains the notational conventions that are used in this
manual.  You may want to skip this section and refer back to it later.

* Menu:

* Some Terms::               Explanation of terms we use in this manual.
* Evaluation Notation::      The format we use for examples of evaluation.
* Printing Notation::        The format we use for examples that print output.
* Error Messages::           The format we use for examples of errors.
* Format of Descriptions::   Notation for describing functions, variables, etc.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Some Terms,  Next: Evaluation Notation,  Prev: Conventions,  Up: Conventions

1.3.1 Some Terms
----------------

Throughout this manual, the phrases "the Kernel reader" and "the Kernel
printer" are used to refer to those routines in Lisp that convert
textual representations of Kernel objects into actual objects, and vice
versa.  XXX Printed Representation XXX, for more details.  You, the
person reading this manual, are assumed to be "the programmer" or "the
user".

   Examples of Kernel code appear in this font or form: `(list 1 2 3)'.
Names that represent arguments or metasyntactic variables appear in
this font or form: FIRST-NUMBER.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Evaluation Notation,  Next: Printing Notation,  Prev: Some Terms,  Up: Conventions

1.3.2 Evaluation Notation
-------------------------

When you evaluate a piece of Kernel code, it produces a result.  In the
examples in this manual, this is indicated with `=>':

     (car (cons 1 2))
          => 1

You can read this as "`(car (cons 1 2))' evaluates to 1".

   The semantics of a language feature are sometimes clarified, or even
defined, in its entry by specifying that two expressions are
equivalent.  This is notated with `=='.  For example, the semantics of
applicative list* can be defined by following equivalences:
     (list* arg1) == arg1
     (list* arg1 . more-args) == (cons arg1 (list* . more-args))
   Notice that in these kind of examples the applicatives or operatives
referred to are the first class values and not the symbols bound to
them in the ground environment.  This definition would hold even if
`cons' or `list*' were redefined in the current dynamic environment.

1.3.3 Printing Notation
-----------------------

Many of the examples in this manual print text when they are evaluated.
In examples that print text, the printed text is indicated with `-|'.
The value returned by evaluating the form (here `#t') follows on a
separate line.

     ($sequence (write 1) (write 2) #t)
          -| 1
          -| 2
          => #t


File: klisp.info,  Node: Error Messages,  Next: Format of Descriptions,  Prev: Printing Notation,  Up: Conventions

1.3.4 Error Messages
--------------------

Some examples cause errors to be signaled.  The report doesn't specify
what objects are passed to the error continuation, but in klisp,
objects passed to the error continuation are encapsulated error objects
that have at least a message and possibly some additional objects and
context informations (such as source code location).  In the examples,
the error message is shown on a line starting with `error-->'.

     (+ 23 #t)
     error--> Wrong type argument: (expected number) (#t)

1.3.5 Format of Descriptions
----------------------------

Applicatives, operatives, and other objects are described in this manual
in a uniform format.  The first line of a description contains the name
of the item followed by its operands or arguments, if any.  The
category--operative, applicative, or whatever--appears at the beginning
of the line.  The description follows on succeeding lines, sometimes
with examples.

* A Sample Applicative Description::


File: klisp.info,  Node: A Sample Applicative Description,  Prev: Format of Descriptions,  Up: Format of Descriptions

1.3.5.1 A Sample Applicative Description
........................................

In an applicative description, the name of the applicative being
described appears first.  It is followed on the same line by an
applicative combination that includes the name of the applicative and
the arguments, as would appear in a program.  The names used for the
arguments are also used in the body of the description.

   Here is a description of an imaginary applicative `foo':

 -- Applicative: foo (foo integer1 integer2 . rest)
     The applicative `foo' subtracts INTEGER1 from INTEGER2, then adds
     all the rest of the arguments to the result.

          (foo 1 5 3 9)
               => 16

     More generally,

          (foo W X Y...)
          ==
          (+ (- X W) Y...)

   Any parameter whose name contains the name of a type (e.g., INTEGER,
INTEGER1 or CONTINUATION) is expected to be of that type.  A plural of
a type (such as NUMBERS) often means a list of objects of that type.
Parameters named OBJECT may be of any type.  Additionally parameters
named K, or KN (for any value of N), should be exact, non-negative
integers.  (XXX Types of Lisp Object XXX, for a list of Kernel object
types.)  Parameters with other sorts of names are discussed
specifically in the description of the combiner.  In some sections,
features common to parameters of several combiners are described at the
beginning.

   Operative descriptions have the same format, but the word
`Applicative' is  replaced by `Operative', and `Argument' is replaced
by `Operand'.  Also Operatives always have an environment parameter
(that can be #ignore or a symbol).

2 Booleans
**********

The boolean data type consists of two values, which are called true and
false, and have respectively external representations `#t' and `#f'.
There are no possible mutations of either of these two values, and the
boolean type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: boolean? (boolean? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type boolean.  `boolean?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type boolean.

 -- Applicative: not? (not? boolean)
     Applicative `not?' is a predicate that returns the logical
     negation of its argument.

 -- Applicative: and? (and? . booleans)
     Applicative `and?' is a predicate that returns true unless one or
     more of its arguments are false.

 -- Applicative: or? (or? . booleans)
     Applicative `or?' is a predicate that returns false unless one or
     more of its arguments are true.

 -- Operative: $and? ($and? . <list>)
     The `$and?' operative performs a "short-circuit and" of its
     operands.  It evaluates them from left to right, until either an
     operand evaluates to false, or the end of the list is reached.  If
     the end of the list is reached (which is immediate if `<list>' is
     `nil'), the operative returns true.  If an operand evaluates to
     false, no further operand evaluations are performed, and the
     operative returns false.  If `<list>' is acyclic, and the last
     operand is evaluated, it is evaluated as a tail context.  If
     `<list>' is cyclic, an unbounded number of operand evaluations may
     be performed.  If any of the operands evaluates to a non-boolean
     value, an error is signaled (even if it's the last one).

 -- Operative: $or? ($or? . <list>)
     The `$or?' operative performs a "short-circuit or" of its
     operands.  It evaluates them from left to right, until either an
     operand evaluates to true, or the end of the list is reached.  If
     the end of the list is reached (which is immediate if `<list>' is
     `nil'), the operative returns false.  If an operand evaluates to
     true, no further operand evaluations are performed, and the
     operative returns true.  If `<list>' is acyclic, and the last
     operand is evaluated, it is evaluated as a tail context.  If
     `<list>' is cyclic, an unbounded number of operand evaluations may
     be performed.  If any of the operands evaluates to a non-boolean
     value, an error is signaled (even if it's the last one).

3 Equivalence
*************

Kernel has two general-purpose equivalence predicates (whereas R5RS
Scheme has three).  The two Kernel predicates correspond to the
abstract notions of equivalence up to mutation (`equal') and
equivalence in the presence of mutation (`eq?').

 -- Applicative: eq? (eq? . objects)
     Predicate `eq?' returns true iff all of `objects' are effectively
     the same object, even in the presence of mutation.

 -- Applicative: equal? (equal? . objects)
     Predicate `equal?' returns true iff all of `objects' "look" the
     same as long as nothing is mutated.  This is a weaker predicate
     than `eq?'; that is, `equal?' must return true whenever `eq?'
     would return true.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Symbols,  Next: Control,  Prev: Equivalence,  Up: Top

4 Symbols
*********

Two symbols are eq? iff they have the same external representation.
Symbols are immutable, and the symbol type is encapsulated.  The
external representations of symbols are usually identifiers.  However,
symbols with other external representations may be created.

 -- Applicative: symbol? (symbol? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type symbol. `symbol?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type symbol.

 -- Applicative: symbol->string (symbol->string symbol)
     Applicative `symbol->string' returns the name of `symbol' as a
     string.  The string returned is immutable.

 -- Applicative: string->symbol (string->symbol string)
     Applicative `string->symbol' returns the symbol with name
     `string'.  The symbol is always interned, which means, that it is
     always the case that:
          (eq? <symbol> (string->symbol (symbol->string <symbol>)))
               => #t
       `string->symbol' can create symbols whose external
     representation aren't identifiers.  Right now klisp uses an
     output-only representation, but in the near future it will
     probably include some kind of escaping mechanism to allow
     arbitrary symbols to have readable external representations as in
     R7RS Scheme.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Control,  Next: Pairs and lists,  Prev: Symbols,  Up: Top

5 Control
*********

The inert data type is provided for use with control combiners.  It
consists of a single immutable value, having external representation
`#inert'.  The inert type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: inert? (inert? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type inert. `inert?' returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type inert.

 -- Operative: $if ($if <test> <consequent> <alternative>)
     The `$if' operative first evaluates `<test>' in the dynamic
     environment.  If the result is not of type boolean, an error is
     signaled.  If the result is true, `<consequent>' is then evaluated
     in the dynamic environment as a tail context.  Otherwise,
     `<alternative>' is evaluated in the dynamic environment as a tail
     context.

 -- Operative: $sequence ($sequence . <objects>)
     The `$sequence' operative evaluates the elements of the list
     `<objects>' in the dynamic environment, one at a time from left to
     right.  If `<objects>' is a cyclic list, element evaluation
     continues indefinitely, with elements in the cycle being evaluated
     repeatedly.  If `<objects>' is a nonempty finite list, its last
     element is evaluated as a tail context.  If `<objects>' is the
     empty list, the result is inert.

 -- Operative: $cond ($cond . <clauses>)
     `<clauses>' should be a list of clause expressions, each of the
     form `(<test> . <body>)', where body is a list of expressions.

     The following equivalences define the behaviour of the `$cond'
     operative:
          ($cond) == #inert
          ($cond (<test> . <body>) . <clauses>) ==
            ($if <test> ($sequence . <body>) ($cond . <clauses>))

 -- Applicative: for-each (for-each . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list of lists; if there are two or
     more, they should all be the same length. If lists is empty, or if
     all of its elements are not lists of the same length, an error is
     signaled.

     `for-each' behaves identically to `map', except that instead of
     accumulating and returning a list of the results of the
     element-wise applications, the results of the applications are
     discarded and the result returned by `for-each' is inert.

6 Pairs and lists
*****************

A pair is an object that refers to two other objects, called its car
and cdr.  The Kernel data type pair is encapsulated.

   The null data type consists of a single immutable value, called nil
or the empty list and having external representation `()', with or
without whitespace between the parentheses. It is immutable, and the
null type is encapsulated.

   If `a' and `d' are external representations of respectively the car
and cdr of a pair `p', then `(a . d)' is an external representation of
`p'. If the cdr of `p' is nil, then `(a)' is also an external
representation of `p'. If the cdr of `p' is a pair `p2', and `(r)' is
an external representation of `p2', then `(a r)' is an external
representation of `p'.    When a pair is output (as by write), an
external representation with the fewest parentheses is used; in the
case of a finite list, only one set of parentheses is required beyond
those used in representing the elements of the list. For example, an
object with external representation `(1 . (2 . (3 . ())))' would be
output using, modulo whitespace, external representation `(1 2 3)'.

 -- Applicative: pair? (pair? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type pair.  `pair?' returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type pair.

 -- Applicative: null? (null? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type null.  `null?' returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type null.

 -- Applicative: cons (cons object1 object2)
     A new mutable pair object is constructed and returned, whose car
     and cdr referents are respectively `object1' and `object2'.  No
     two objects returned by different calls to cons are `eq?' to each
     other.

 -- Applicative: set-car! (set-car! pair object)
 -- Applicative: set-cdr! (set-cdr! pair object)
     `pair' should be a mutable pair.

     These applicatives set the referent of, respectively, the car
     reference or the cdr reference of `pair' to `object'.  The result
     of the expression is inert.

 -- Applicative: copy-es-immutable! (copy-es-immutable object)
     The short description of this applicative is that it returns an
     object `equal?' to `object' with an immutable evaluation
     structure. The "-es-" in the name is short for "evaluation
     structure".

     The evaluation structure of an object `o' is defined to be the set
     of all pairs that can be reached by following chains of references
     from `o' without ever passing through a non-pair object. The
     evaluation structure of a non-pair object is empty.

     If `object' is not a pair, the applicative returns `object'.
     Otherwise (if `object' is a pair), the applicative returns an
     immutable pair whose car and cdr would be suitable results for
     `(copy-es-immutable (car object))' and `(copy-es-immutable (cdr
     object))', respectively.  Further, the evaluation structure of the
     returned value is isomorphic to that of `object' at the time of
     copying, with corresponding non-pair referents being `eq?'.

     NOTE: In Kernel it's undefined whether immutable pairs are copied
     or left "as is" in the result.  klisp doesn't copy immutable
     pairs, but that behaviour should not be depended upon.

 -- Applicative: list (list . objects)
     The `list' applicative returns `objects'.

     The underlying operative of `list' returns its undifferentiated
     operand tree, regardless of whether that tree is or is not a list.

 -- Applicative: list* (list* . objects)
     `objects' should be a finite nonempty list of arguments.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (list* arg1) == arg1
          (list* arg1 arg2 . args) == (cons arg1 (list* arg2 . args))

 -- Applicative: car (car pair)
 -- Applicative: cdr (cdr pair)
     These applicatives return, respectively, the car and cdr of `pair'.

 -- Applicative: caar (caar pair)
 -- Applicative: cadr (cadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdar (cdar pair)
 -- Applicative: cddr (cddr pair)
 -- Applicative: caaar (caaar pair)
 -- Applicative: caadr (caadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cadar (cadar pair)
 -- Applicative: caddr (caddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaar (cdaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdadr (cdadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cddar (cddar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdddr (cdddr pair)
 -- Applicative: caaaar (caaaar pair)
 -- Applicative: caaadr (caaadr pair)
 -- Applicative: caadar (caadar pair)
 -- Applicative: caaddr (caaddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cadaar (cadaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cadadr (cadadr pair)
 -- Applicative: caddar (caddar pair)
 -- Applicative: cadddr (cadddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaaar (cdaaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaadr (cdaadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdadar (cdadar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaddr (cdaddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cddaar (cddaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cddadr (cddadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdddar (cdddar pair)
 -- Applicative: cddddr (cddddr pair)
     These applicatives are compositions of `car' and `cdr', with the
     "a’s" and "d’s" in the same order as they would appear if all the
     individual "car’s" and "cdr’s" were written out in prefix order.
     Arbitrary compositions up to four deep are provided. There are
     twenty-eight of these applicatives in all.

 -- Applicative: get-list-metrics (get-list-metrics object)
     By definition, an improper list is a data structure whose objects
     are its start together with all objects reachable from the start by
     following the cdr references of pairs, and whose internal
     references are just the cdr references of its pairs.  Every
     object, of whatever type, is the start of an improper list.  If
     the start is not a pair, the improper list consists of just that
     object.  The acyclic prefix length of an improper list `L' is the
     number of pairs of `L' that a naive traversal of `L' would visit
     only once. The cycle length of `L' is the number of pairs of `L'
     that a naive traversal would visit repeatedly. Two improper lists
     are structurally isomorphic iff they have the same acyclic prefix
     length and cycle length and, if they are terminated by non-pair
     objects rather than by cycles, the non-pair objects have the same
     type.  Applicative `get-list-metrics' constructs and returns a
     list of exact integers of the form `(p n a c)', where `p', `n',
     `a', and `c' are, respectively, the number of pairs in, the number
     of nil objects in, the acyclic prefix length of, and the cycle
     length of, the improper list starting with `object'. `n' is either
     `0' or `1', `a + c = p', and `n' and `c' cannot both be non-zero.
     If `c = 0', the improper list is acyclic; if `n = 1', the improper
     list is a finite list; if `n = c = 0', the improper list is not a
     list; if `a = c = 0', `object' is not a pair.

 -- Applicative: list-tail (list-tail object k)
     `object' must be the start of an improper list containing at least
     `k' pairs.

     The `list-tail' applicative follows `k' cdr references starting
     from `object'.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (list-tail object 0) == object
          (list-tail object (+ k 1)) == (list-tail (cdr object) k)

 -- Applicative: encycle! (encycle! object k1 k2)
     The improper list starting at `object' must contain at least `k1 +
     k2' pairs.

     If `k2 = 0', the applicative does nothing. If `k2 > 0', the
     applicative mutates the improper list starting at `object' to have
     acyclic prefix length `k1' and cycle length `k2', by setting the
     cdr of the `(k1+k2)'th pair in the list to refer to the `(k1 +
     1)'th pair in the list.  The result returned by `encycle!' is
     inert.

 -- Applicative: map (map applicative . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list of lists; if there are two or
     more, they must all have the same length.

     The map applicative applies `applicative' element-wise to the
     elements of the lists in lists (i.e., applies it to a list of the
     first elements of the lists, to a list of the second elements of
     the lists, etc.), using the dynamic environment from which map was
     called, and returns a list of the results, in order. The
     applications may be performed in any order, as long as their
     results occur in the resultant list in the order of their
     arguments in the original lists.  If `lists' is a cyclic list,
     each argument list to which `applicative' is applied is
     structurally isomorphic to `lists'.  If any of the elements of
     `lists' is a cyclic list, they all must be, or they wouldn’t all
     have the same length.  Let `a1...an' be their acyclic prefix
     lengths, and `c1...cn' be their cycle lengths.  The acyclic prefix
     length `a' of the resultant list will be the maximum of the `ak',
     while the cycle length `c' of the resultant list will be the least
     common multiple of the `ck'.  In the construction of the result,
     `applicative' is called exactly `a + c' times.

 -- Applicative: length (length object)
     Applicative `length' returns the (exact) improper-list length of
     `object'.  That is, it returns the number of consecutive cdr
     references that can be followed starting from `object'.  If
     `object' is not a pair, it returns zero; if `object' is a cyclic
     list, it returns positive infinity.

 -- Applicative: list-ref (list-ref object k)
     The `list-ref' applicative returns the `car' of the object
     obtained by following `k' cdr references starting from `object'.

     NOTE: In the current report, object is required to be a list. In
     klisp, for now, we prefer the behaviour presented here, as it is
     more in line with the applicative `list-tail'.  That is, we define
     `list-ref' by the following equivalence:
          (list-ref object k) == (car (list-tail object k))

 -- Applicative: append (append . lists)
     Here, all the elements of `lists' except the last element (if any)
     must be acyclic lists.  The `append' applicative returns a freshly
     allocated list of the elements of all the specified `lists', in
     order, except that if there is a last specified element of
     `lists', it is not copied, but is simply referenced by the cdr of
     the preceding pair (if any) in the resultant list.  If `lists' is
     cyclic, the cycle of the result list consists of just the elements
     of the lists specified in the cycle in `lists'. In this case, the
     acyclic prefix length of the result is the sum of the lengths of
     the lists specified in the acyclic prefix of `lists', and the
     cycle length of the result is the sum of the lengths of the lists
     specified in the cycle of `lists'.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (append) == ()
          (append h) == h
          (append () h . t) == (append h . t)
          (append (cons a b) h . t) == (cons a (append b h . t))

 -- Applicative: list-neighbors (list-neighbors list)
     The `list-neighbors' applicative constructs and returns a list of
     all the consecutive sublists of `list' of length 2, in order.  If
     `list' is nil, the result is nil.  If `list' is non-nil, the
     length of the result is one less than the length of `list'. If
     `list' is cyclic, the result is structurally isomorphic to it
     (i.e., has the same acyclic prefix length and cycle length).

     For example:
          (list-neighbors (list 1 2 3 4)) => ((1 2) (2 3) (3 4))

 -- Applicative: filter (filter applicative list)
     Applicative `filter' passes each of the elements of `list' as an
     argument to `applicative', one at a time in no particular order,
     using a fresh empty environment for each call.  The result of each
     call to `applicative' must be boolean, otherwise an error is
     signaled.  `filter' constructs and returns a list of all elements
     of `list' on which `applicative' returned true, in the same order
     as in `list'.  `applicative' is called exactly as many times as
     there are pairs in `list'.  The resultant list has a cycle
     containing exactly those elements accepted by `applicative' that
     were in the cycle of `list'; if there were no such elements, the
     result is acyclic.

 -- Applicative: assoc (assoc object pairs)
     Applicative `assoc' returns the first element of `pairs' whose car
     is `equal?' to `object'.  If there is no such element in `pairs',
     nil is returned.

 -- Applicative: member? (member? object list)
     Applicative `member?' is a predicate that returns true iff some
     element of `list' is `equal?' to `object'.

 -- Applicative: finite-list? (finite-list? . objects)
     This is the type predicate for type finite-list.  `finite-list?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are acyclic lists.

 -- Applicative: countable-list? (countable-list? . objects)
     This is the type predicate for type list.  `countable-list?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are lists.

 -- Applicative: reduce (reduce list binary identity [precycle incycle
          postcycle])
     `binary' should be an applicative. If the short form is used,
     `list' should be an acyclic. If the long form is used, `precycle',
     `incycle', and `postcycle' should be applicatives.

     If `list' is empty, applicative `reduce' returns `identity'.  If
     `list' is nonempty but acyclic, applicative `reduce' uses binary
     operation `binary' to merge all the elements of `list' into a
     single object, using any associative grouping of the elements.
     That is, the sequence of objects initially found in `list' is
     repeatedly decremented in length by applying `binary' to a list of
     any two consecutive objects, replacing those two objects with the
     result at the point in the sequence where they occurred; and when
     the sequence contains only one object, that object is returned.
     If `list' is cyclic, the long form must be used.  The elements of
     the cycle are passed, one at a time (but just once for each
     position in the cycle), as arguments to unary applicative
     `precycle'; the finite, cyclic sequence of results from `precycle'
     is reduced using binary applicative `incycle'; and the result from
     reducing the cycle is passed as an argument to unary applicative
     `postcycle'. Binary operation `binary' is used to reduce the
     sequence consisting of the elements of the acyclic prefix of
     `list' followed by the result returned by `postcycle'. The only
     constraint on the order of calls to the applicatives is that each
     call must be made before its result is needed (thus, parts of the
     reduction of the acyclic prefix may occur before the contribution
     from the cycle has been completed).

     Each call to `binary', `precycle', `incycle', or `postcycle' uses
     the dynamic environment of the call to `reduce'.

     If `list' is acyclic with length `n >= 1', `binary' is called `n -
     1' times.  If `list' is cyclic with acyclic prefix length `a' and
     cycle length `c', `binary' is called `a' times; `precycle', `c'
     times; `incycle', `c - 1' times; and `postcycle', once.

 -- Applicative: append! (append! . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list; its first element must be an
     acyclic nonempty list, and all of its elements except the last
     element (if any) must be acyclic lists.

     The `append!' applicative sets the cdr of the last pair in each
     nonempty list argument to refer to the next non-nil argument,
     except that if there is a last non-nil argument, it isn’t mutated.
     It is an error for any two of the list arguments to have the same
     last pair.  The result returned by this applicative is inert.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (append! v) == #inert
          (append! u v . w) == ($sequence (append! u v) (append! u . w))

 -- Applicative: copy-es (copy-es object)
     Briefly, applicative `copy-es' returns an object initially
     `equal?' to `object' with a freshly constructed evaluation
     structure made up of mutable pairs.  If `object' is not a pair,
     the applicative returns `object'.  If `object' is a pair, the
     applicative returns a freshly constructed pair whose car and cdr
     would be suitable results for `(copy-es (car object))' and
     `(copy-es (cdr object))', respectively.  Further, the evaluation
     structure of the returned value is structurally isomorphic to that
     of `object' at the time of copying, with corresponding non-pair
     referents being `eq?'.

 -- Applicative: assq (assq object pairs)
     Applicative `assq' returns the first element of `pairs' whose car
     is `eq?' to `object'.  If there is no such element in `pairs', nil
     is returned.

 -- Applicative: memq? (memq? object list)
     Applicative `memq?' is a predicate that returns true iff some
     element of `list' is `eq?' to `object'.

7 Environments
**************

An environment consists of a set of bindings, and a list of zero or
more references to other environments called its parents.  Changing the
set of bindings of an environment, or setting the referent of the
reference in a binding, is a mutation of the environment. (Changing the
parent list, or a referent in the list, would be a mutation of the
environment too, but there is no facility provided to do it.) The
Kernel data type environment is encapsulated.  Among other things,
there is no facility provided for enumerating all the variables
exhibited by an environment (which is not required, after all, to be a
finite set), and no facility for identifying the parents of an
environment.  Two environments are `equal?' iff they are `eq?'.

   An auxiliary data type used by combiners that perform binding is
ignore. The ignore type consists of a single immutable value, having
external representation `#ignore'.  The ignore type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: environment? (environment? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type environment.  `environment?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type
     environment.

 -- Applicative: ignore? (ignore? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type ignore.  `ignore?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type ignore.

 -- Applicative: eval (eval expression environment)
     The `eval' applicative evaluates `expression' as a tail context in
     `environment', and returns the resulting value.

 -- Applicative: make-environment (make-environment . environments)
     The applicative constructs and returns a new environment, with
     initially no local bindings, and parent environments the
     environments listed in `environments'. The constructed environment
     internally stores its list of parents independent of the
     first-class list `environments', so that subsequent mutation of
     `environments' will not change the parentage of the constructed
     environment. If the provided list `environments' is cyclic, the
     constructed environment will still check each of its parents at
     most once, and signal an error if no binding is found locally or
     in any of the parents.  No two objects returned by different calls
     to `make-environment' are `eq?' to each other.

 -- Operative: $define! ($define! <definiend> <expression>)
     `<definiend>' should be a formal parameter tree, as described
     below; otherwise, an error is signaled.

     The `$define!' operative evaluates `<expression>' in the dynamic
     environment and matches `<definiend>' to the result in the dynamic
     environment, binding each symbol in definiend in the dynamic
     environment to the corresponding part of the result; the matching
     process will be further described below. The ancestors of the
     dynamic environment, if any, are unaffected by the matching
     process, as are all bindings, local to the dynamic environment, of
     symbols not in `<definiend>'.  The result returned by `$define!' is
     inert.

     A formal parameter tree has the following context-free structure:
          ptree:: symbol | #ignore | () | (ptree . ptree)

     That is, a formal parameter tree is either a symbol, or ignore, or
     nil, or a pair whose car and cdr referents are formal parameter
     trees.  A formal parameter tree must also be acyclic, and no one
     symbol can occur more than once in it.  It is not an error for a
     pair in the tree to be reachable from the root by more than one
     path, as long as there is no cycle; but if any particular symbol
     were reachable from the root by more than one path, that would
     count as occurring more than once.  Thus, if a pair is reachable
     by more than one path, there must be no symbols reachable from it.

     Matching of a formal parameter tree `t' to an object `o' in an
     environment `e' proceeds recursively as follows.  If the matching
     process fails, an error is signaled.
        * If `t' is a symbol, then `t' is bound to `o' in `e'.

        * If `t' is `#ignore', no action is taken.

        * If `t' is nil, then `o' must be nil (else matching fails).

        * If `t' is a pair, then `o' must be a pair (else matching
          fails). The car of `t' is matched to the car of `o' in `e',
          and the cdr of `t' is matched to the cdr of `o' in `e'.

 -- Operative: $let ($let <bindings> . <objects>)
     `<bindings>' should be a finite list of
     formal-parameter-tree/expression pairings, each of the form
     `(formals expression)', where each `formals' is a formal
     parameter, and no symbol occurs in more than one of the `formals'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($let ((form1 exp1) ... (formn expn)) . objects) ==
            (($lambda (form1 ... formn) . objects) exp1 ... expn)

     Thus, the `expk' are first evaluated in the dynamic environment,
     in any order; then a child environment `e' of the dynamic
     environment is created, with the `formk' matched in `e' to the
     results of the evaluations of the `expk'; and finally the
     subexpressions of `objects' are evaluated in `e' from left to
     right, with the last (if any) evaluated as a tail context, or if
     `objects' is empty the result is inert.

 -- Operative: $binds? ($binds? <exp> . <symbols>)
     Operative `$binds' evaluates `<exp>' in the dynamic environment;
     call the result `env'.  `env' must be an environment.  The
     operative is a predicate that returns true iff all its later
     operands, `<symbols>', are visibly bound in `env'.

 -- Applicative: get-current-environment (get-current-environment)
     The `get-current-environment' applicative returns the dynamic
     environment in which it is called.

 -- Applicative: make-kernel-standard-environment
          (make-kernel-standard-environment)
     The `make-kernel-standard-environment' applicative returns a
     standard environment; that is, a child of the ground environment
     with no local bindings.

 -- Operative: $let* ($let* <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' should be a finite list of
     formal-parameter-tree/expression pairings, each of the form
     `(formals expression)', where each `formals' is a formal parameter
     tree; `<body>' should be a list of expressions.

     The following equivalences hold:

          ($let* () . body) == ($let () . body)

          ($let* ((form exp) . bindings) . body) ==
            ($let ((form exp)) ($let* bindings . body))

 -- Operative: $letrec ($letrec <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:
          ($letrec ((form1 exp1) ... (formn expn)) . body) ==
            ($let () ($define! (form1 ... formn) (list exp1 ... expn)) . body)

 -- Operative: $letrec* ($letrec* <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let*'.

     The following equivalences hold:
          ($letrec* () . body) == ($letrec () . body)

          ($letrec* ((form exp) . bindings) . body) ==
            ($letrec ((form exp)) ($letrec* bindings . body))

 -- Operative: $let-redirect ($let-redirect <exp> <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($let-redirect exp ((form1 exp1) ... (formn . body) expn)) ==
            ((eval (list $lambda (form1 ... formn) body) exp) expn ... expn)

 -- Operative: $let-safe ($let-safe <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($let-safe bindings . body) ==
            ($let-redirect (make-kernel-standard-environment) bindings . body)

 -- Operative: $remote-eval ($remote-eval <exp1> <exp2>)
     Operative `$remote-eval' evaluates `<exp2>' in the dynamic
     environment, then evaluates `<exp1>' as a tail context in the
     environment that must result from the first evaluation.

 -- Operative: ($bindings-environment . <bindings>)
     `<bindings>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($bindings->environment . bindings) ==
            ($let-redirect (make-environment) bindings (get-current-environment))

 -- Operative: $set! ($set! <exp1> <formals> <exp2>)
     `<formals>' should be as described for the `$define!' operative.
     The `$set!' operative evaluates `<exp1>' and `<exp2>' in the
     dynamic environment; call the results `env' and `obj'.  If `env'
     is not an environment, an error is signaled.  Then the operative
     matches `<formals>' to `obj' in environment `env'.  Thus, the
     symbols of `<formals>' are bound in `env' to the corresponding
     parts of `obj'.  The result returned by `$set!' is inert.

 -- Operative: $provide! ($provide! <symbols> . <body>)
     `<symbols>' must be a finite list of symbols, containing no
     duplicates.  `<body>' must be a finite list.

     The `$provide!' operative constructs a child `e' of the dynamic
     environment `d'; evaluates the elements of `<body>' in `e', from
     left to right, discarding all of the results; and exports all of
     the bindings of symbols in `<symbols>' from `e' to `d', i.e.,
     binds each symbol in `d' to the result of looking it up in `e'.
     The result returned by `$provide!'  is inert.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($provide!  symbols . body) ==
          ($define!  symbols ($let () ($sequence . body) (list . symbols)))

 -- Operative: $import! ($import! <exp> . <symbols>)
     `<symbols>' must be a list of symbols.

     The `$import!' operative evaluates `<exp>' in the dynamic
     environment; call the result `env'. `env' must be an environment.
     Each distinct symbol `s' in `<symbols>' is evaluated in `env', and
     `s' is bound in the dynamic environment to the result of this
     evaluation.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($import! exp . symbols) ==
          ($define! symbols ($remote-eval (list symbols) exp))

8 Combiners
***********

There are two types of combiners in Kernel, operative and applicative.
Both types are encapsulated. All combiners are immutable.  Two
applicatives are `eq?' iff their underlying combiners are `eq?'.
However, `eq?'-ness of operatives is only constrained by the general
rules for `eq?', which leave considerable leeway for variation between
implementations.  klisp only considers `eq?' those operatives
constructed by the same call to a constructor (e.g. `$vau').  Two
combiners are `equal?' iff they are `eq?'.

 -- Applicative: operative? (operative? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type operative. `operative?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type
     operative.

 -- Applicative: applicative? (applicative? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type applicative.  `applicative?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type
     applicative.

 -- Operative: $vau ($vau <formals> <eformal> . <objects>)
     `<formals>' should be a formal parameter tree; `<eformal>' should
     be either a symbol or `#ignore'.  If `<formals>' does not have the
     correct form for a formal parameter tree, or if `<eformal>' is a
     symbol that also occurs in `<formals>', an error is signaled.

     A `vau' expression evaluates to an operative; an operative created
     in this way is said to be compound. The environment in which the
     `vau' expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the
     compound operative, called the compound operative’s static
     environment.  `<formals>' and `<objects>' are copied as by
     `copy-es-immutable' and the copies are stored as part of the
     operative being constructed.  This avoids problem if these
     structures are later mutated.

     When the compound operative created by `$vau' is later called with
     an object and an environment, here called respectively the operand
     tree and the dynamic environment, the following happens:

       1. A new, initially empty environment is created, with the static
          environment as its parent. This will be called the local
          environment.

       2. A stored copy of the formal parameter tree formals is matched
          in the local environment to the operand tree, locally binding
          the symbols of formals to the corresponding parts of the
          operand tree.  eformal is matched to the dynamic environment;
          that is, if eformal is a symbol then that symbol is bound in
          the local environment to the dynamic environment.

       3. A stored copy of the expressions is evaluated sequentially
          from left to right, with the last (if any) evaluated as a
          tail context, or if the list of expressions is empty, the
          result is inert.

     NOTE: Because compound operatives are not a distinct type in
     Kernel, they are covered by the encapsulation of type operative.
     In particular, an implementation of Kernel cannot provide a
     feature that supports extracting the static environment of any
     given compound operative, nor that supports determining whether or
     not a given operative is compound.

 -- Applicative: wrap (wrap combiner)
     The `wrap' applicative returns an applicative whose underlying
     combiner is `combiner'.

 -- Applicative: unwrap (unwrap applicative)
     The `unwrap' applicative returns the underlying combiner of
     `applicative'.

 -- Operative: $lambda ($lambda <formals> . <objects>)
     `<formals>' should be a formal parameter tree.

     The `$lambda' operative is defined by the following equivalence:
          ($lambda formals . objects) ==
            (wrap ($vau formals #ignore . objects))

 -- Applicative: apply (apply applicative object [environment])
     Applicative `apply' combines the underlying combiner of
     `applicative' with `object' in a tail context with dynamic
     environment `environment' (if the long form is used) or in an
     empty environment (if the short form is used).

     The following equivalences hold:
          (apply applicative object environment) ==
            (eval (cons (unwrap applicative) object) environment)

          (apply applicative object) ==
            (apply applicative object (make-environment))

 -- Applicative: map (map applicative . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list of lists; if there are two or
     more, they must all have the same length. If `lists' is empty, or
     if all of its elements are not lists of the same length, an error
     is signaled.

     The `map' applicative applies `applicative' element-wise to the
     elements of the lists in `lists' (i.e., applies it to a list of
     the first elements of the `lists', to a list of the second
     elements of the `lists', etc.), using the dynamic environment from
     which `map' was called, and returns a list of the results, in
     order. The applications may be performed in any order, as long as
     their results occur in the resultant list in the order of their
     arguments in the original `lists'.  If `lists' is a cyclic list,
     each argument list to which `applicative' is applied is
     structurally isomorphic to `lists'.  If any of the elements of
     `lists' is a cyclic list, they all must be, or they wouldn’t all
     have the same length.  Let `a1...an' be their acyclic prefix
     lengths, and `c1...cn' be their cycle lengths.  The acyclic prefix
     length `a' of the resultant list will be the maximum of the `ak',
     while the cycle length `c' of the resultant list will be the least
     common multiple of the `ck'.  In the construction of the result,
     applicative is called exactly `a + c' times.

 -- Applicative: combiner? (combiner? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type combiner. `combiner?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type combiner
     (i.e. applicative or operative).

9 Continuations
***************

A continuation is a plan for all future computation, parameterized by a
value to be provided, and contingent on the states of all mutable data
structures (which notably may include environments). When the Kernel
evaluator is invoked, the invoker provides a continuation to which the
result of the evaluation will normally be returned.

   For example, when `$if' evaluates its test operand, the continuation
provided for the result expects to be given a boolean value; and,
depending on which boolean it gets, it will evaluate either the
consequent or the alternative operand as a tail context — that is, the
continuation provided for the result of evaluating the selected operand
is the same continuation that was provided for the result of the call
to `$if'.

   A Kernel program may sometimes capture a continuation; that is,
acquire a reference to it as a first-class object. The basic means of
continuation capture is applicative `call/cc'.  Given a first-class
continuation `c', a combiner can be constructed that will abnormally
pass its operand tree to `c' (as opposed to the normal return of values
to continuations). In the simplest case, the abnormally passed value
arrives at `c' as if it had been normally returned to `c'. In general,
continuations bypassed by the abnormal pass may have entry/exit guards
attached to them, and these guards can intercept the abnormal pass
before it reaches `c'.  Each entry/exit guard consists of a selector
continuation, which designates which abnormal passes the guard will
intercept, and an interceptor applicative that performs the
interception when selected.

   Continuations are immutable, and are `equal?' iff `eq?'.  The
continuation type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: continuation? (continuation? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type continuation.
     `continuation?' returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are
     of type continuation.

 -- Applicative: call/cc (call/cc combiner)
     Calls `combiner' in the dynamic environment as a tail context,
     passing as sole operand to it the continuation to which `call/cc'
     would normally return its result.  (That is, constructs such a
     combination and evaluates it in the dynamic environment.)

 -- Applicative: extend-continuation (extend-continuation continuation
          applicative [environment])
     The `extend-continuation' applicative constructs and returns a new
     child of `continuation' that, when it normally receives a value v,
     calls the underlying combiner of `applicative' with dynamic
     environment `environment' (or an empty environment if none was
     specified) and operand tree `v', the result of the call normally
     to be returned to `continuation'.

     The following equivalnece defines the short version:
          (extend-continuation c a) ==
            (extend-continuation c a (make-environment))

 -- Applicative: guard-continuation (guard-continuation entry-guards
          continuation exit-guards)
     `entry-guards' and `exit-guards' should each be a list of clauses;
     each clause should be a list of length two, whose first element is
     a continuation, and whose second element is an applicative whose
     underlying combiner is operative.

     Applicative `guard-continuation' constructs two continuations: a
     child of continuation, called the `outer continuation'; and a
     child of the `outer continuation', called the `inner
     continuation'.  The `inner continuation' is returned as the result
     of the call to `guard-continuation'.

     When the `inner continuation' normally receives a value, it passes
     the value normally to the `outer continuation'; and when the
     `outer continuation' normally receives a value, it passes the
     value normally to `continuation'. Thus, in the absence of abnormal
     passing, the inner and outer continuations each have the same
     behavior as `continuation'.

     The two elements of each guard clause are called, respectively, the
     `selector' and the `interceptor'.  The `selector' continuation is
     used in deciding whether to intercept a given abnormal pass, and
     the `interceptor' applicative is called to perform customized
     action when interception occurs.

     At the beginning of the call to `guard-continuation', internal
     copies are made of the evaluation structures of `entry-guards' and
     `exit-guards', so that the selectors and interceptors contained in
     the arguments at that time remain fixed thereafter, independent of
     any subsequent mutations to the arguments.

 -- Applicative: continuation->applicative (continuation->applicative
          continuation)
     Returns an applicative whose underlying operative abnormally passes
     its operand tree to `continuation', thus: A series of interceptors
     are selected to handle the abnormal pass, and a continuation is
     derived that will normally perform all the interceptions in
     sequence and pass some value to the destination of the originally
     abnormal pass.  The operand tree is then normally passed to the
     derived continuation.

 -- Variable: root-continuation
     This continuation is the ancestor of all other continuations. When
     it normally receives a value, it terminates the Kernel session.
     (For example, if the system is running a read-eval-print loop, it
     exits the loop.)

 -- Variable: error-continuation
     The dynamic extent of this continuation is mutually disjoint from
     the dynamic extent in which Kernel computation usually occurs
     (such as the dynamic extent in which the Kernel system would run a
     read-eval-print loop).

     When this continuation normally receives a value, it provides a
     diagnostic message to the user of the Kernel system, on the
     assumption that the received value is an attempt to describe some
     error that aborted a computation; and then resumes operation of
     the Kernel system at some point that is outside of all
     user-defined computation. (For example, if the system is running a
     read-eval-print loop, operation may resume by continuing from the
     top of the loop.)

     The diagnostic message is not made available to any Kernel
     computation, and is therefore permitted to contain information that
     violates abstractions within the system.

     When an error is signaled during a Kernel computation, the
     signaling action consists of an abnormal pass to some continuation
     in the dynamic extent of `error-continuation'.

 -- Applicative: apply-continuation (apply-continuation continuation
          object)
     Applicative `apply-continuation' converts its first argument to an
     applicative as if by `continuation->applicative', and then applies
     it as usual.

     That is:
          (apply-continuation continuation object) ==
            (apply (continuation->applicative continuation) object)

 -- Operative: ($let/cc <symbol> . <objects>)
     A child environment `e' of the dynamic environment is created,
     containing a binding of `<symbol>' to the continuation to which
     the result of the call to `$let/cc' should normally return; then,
     the subexpressions of `<objects>' are evaluated in `e' from left
     to right, with the last (if any) evaluated as a tail context, or
     if `<objects>' is empty the result is inert.

     That is:
          ($let/cc symbol . objects) ==
            (call/cc ($lambda (symbol) . objects))

 -- Applicative: guard-dynamic-extent (guard-dynamic-extent
          entry-guards combiner exit-guards)
     This applicative extends the current continuation with the
     specified guards, and calls `combiner' in the dynamic extent of
     the new continuation, with no operands and the dynamic environment
     of the call to `guard-dynamic-extent'.

 -- Applicative: exit (exit)
     Applicative `exit' initiates an abnormal transfer of `#inert' to
     `root-continuation'.

     That is:
          (exit ) == (apply-continuation root-continuation #inert)
