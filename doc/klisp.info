1 Introduction
**************

klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
Language.  It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
the `Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language', but that
probably won't happen for some time.  It is written in C99 under the
MIT license.  It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source code &
file structure.  It uses the IMath library for arbitrary sized integers
and rationals.

   The Kernel programming language is a statically scoped and properly
tail-recursive dialect of Lisp, descended from Scheme.  It is designed
to be simpler and more general than Scheme, with an exceptionally
clear, simple, and versatile semantics, only one way to form compound
expressions, and no inessential restrictions on the power of that one
compound form.  Imperative, functional, and message-passing programming
styles (to name a few) may be conveniently expressed in Kernel.

   An important property of Kernel is that all manipulable entities in
Kernel are first-class objects.  In particular, Kernel has no
second-class combiners; instead, the roles of special forms and macros
are subsumed by operatives, which are first-class, statically scoped
combiners that act directly on their unevaluated operands.  Kernel also
has a second type of combiners, applicatives, which act on their evalu-
ated arguments.  Applicatives are roughly equivalent to Scheme
procedures.  However, an applicative is nothing more than a wrapper to
induce operand evaluation, around an underlying operative (or, in
principle, around another applicative, though that isn’t usually done);
applicatives themselves are mere facilitators to computation.

   This manual describes klisp version 0.2, presuming some familiarity
with the Lisp family of languages in general, and with the Kernel
Programming Language in particular.  There are frequent references to
the Kernel Programming Language Report.  Unlike in the report, no
rationale is provided for any feature, only a description of the
implemented functionality.

1.1 Caveats
===========

This is the first draft of this manual.  It will be incomplete for some
time.  It will also evolve, together with klisp and the Kernel
Programming Language, both of which, right now, are in a quite fluid
state.

   The main reference on Kernel is the preliminary report: `Revised(-1)
Report on the Kernel Programming Language'.  Some sections of the
report are still incomplete, so both klisp and this manual will use
specifications from other languages in these sections, trying to follow
the Kernel spirit.  These instances will be documented throughout the
manual.

   Please mail comments and corrections to <canavarro82@gmail.com>.

1.2 Kernel History
==================

The Kernel Programming Language is a work in progress.  It is being
developed by John N. Shutt, Ph.D, who created it while studying at the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (I think about 2002, or so... ASK).  It
is descended from scheme, with the idea that all objects should be
first class values.  In particular, Kernel replaces macros with
operatives (kinda like statically scoped fexprs and fsubrs) and has
first class environments.  Kernel also has the notion of encapsulated
objects which limits the ammount of information an implementation can
share with a Kernel program (e.g. There is no way in Kernel to get the
parents or a complete list of bindings of an environment object).

   The main reference on Kernel is the preliminary report: `Revised(-1)
Report on the Kernel Programming Language'.  Some sections of the
report are still incomplete, so both klisp and this manual will use
specifications from other languages in these sections, trying to follow
the Kernel spirit.  These instances will be documented throughout the
manual.

   You can read all about Kernel at John's homepage at WPI
`http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/', including the preliminary report on
the language and his doctoral dissertation which gives a theorethical
frame for fexprs.  You can contact him at <jshutt@cs.wpi.edu>.

1.3 Conventions

This section explains the notational conventions that are used in this
manual.  You may want to skip this section and refer back to it later.

* Some Terms::               Explanation of terms we use in this manual.
* Evaluation Notation::      The format we use for examples of evaluation.
* Printing Notation::        The format we use for examples that print output.

File: klisp.info,  Node: Some Terms,  Next: Evaluation Notation,  Prev: Conventions,  Up: Conventions

1.3.1 Some Terms
----------------

Throughout this manual, the phrases "the Kernel reader" and "the Kernel
printer" are used to refer to those routines in Lisp that convert
textual representations of Kernel objects into actual objects, and vice
versa.  XXX Printed Representation XXX, for more details.  You, the
person reading this manual, are assumed to be "the programmer" or "the
user".

   Examples of Kernel code appear in this font or form: `(list 1 2 3)'.
Names that represent arguments or metasyntactic variables appear in
this font or form: FIRST-NUMBER.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Evaluation Notation,  Next: Printing Notation,  Prev: Some Terms,  Up: Conventions

1.3.2 Evaluation Notation
-------------------------

When you evaluate a piece of Kernel code, it produces a result.  In the
examples in this manual, this is indicated with `=>':

     (car (cons 1 2))
          => 1

You can read this as "`(car (cons 1 2))' evaluates to 1".

   The semantics of a language feature are sometimes clarified, or even
defined, in its entry by specifying that two expressions are
equivalent.  This is notated with `=='.  For example, the semantics of
applicative list* can be defined by following equivalences:
     (list* arg1) == arg1
     (list* arg1 . more-args) == (cons arg1 (list* . more-args))
   Notice that in these kind of examples the applicatives or operatives
referred to are the first class values and not the symbols bound to
them in the ground environment.  This definition would hold even if
`cons' or `list*' were redefined in the current dynamic environment.

1.3.3 Printing Notation
-----------------------

Many of the examples in this manual print text when they are evaluated.
In examples that print text, the printed text is indicated with `-|'.
The value returned by evaluating the form (here `#t') follows on a
separate line.

     ($sequence (write 1) (write 2) #t)

          -| 2
          => #t


File: klisp.info,  Node: Error Messages,  Next: Format of Descriptions,  Prev: Printing Notation,  Up: Conventions

1.3.4 Error Messages
--------------------

Some examples cause errors to be signaled.  The report doesn't specify
what objects are passed to the error continuation, but in klisp,
objects passed to the error continuation are encapsulated error objects
that have at least a message and possibly some additional objects and
context informations (such as source code location).  In the examples,
the error message is shown on a line starting with `error-->'.

     (+ 23 #t)
     error--> Wrong type argument: (expected number) (#t)

1.3.5 Format of Descriptions
----------------------------

Applicatives, operatives, and other objects are described in this manual
in a uniform format.  The first line of a description contains the name
of the item followed by its operands or arguments, if any.  The
category--operative, applicative, or whatever--appears at the beginning
of the line.  The description follows on succeeding lines, sometimes
with examples.

* A Sample Applicative Description::


File: klisp.info,  Node: A Sample Applicative Description,  Prev: Format of Descriptions,  Up: Format of Descriptions

1.3.5.1 A Sample Applicative Description
........................................

In an applicative description, the name of the applicative being
described appears first.  It is followed on the same line by an
applicative combination that includes the name of the applicative and
the arguments, as would appear in a program.  The names used for the
arguments are also used in the body of the description.

   Here is a description of an imaginary applicative `foo':

 -- Applicative: foo (foo integer1 integer2 . rest)
     The applicative `foo' subtracts INTEGER1 from INTEGER2, then adds
     all the rest of the arguments to the result.

          (foo 1 5 3 9)
               => 16

     More generally,

          (foo W X Y...)
          ==
          (+ (- X W) Y...)

   Any parameter whose name contains the name of a type (e.g., INTEGER,
INTEGER1 or CONTINUATION) is expected to be of that type.  A plural of
a type (such as NUMBERS) often means a list of objects of that type.
Parameters named OBJECT may be of any type.  Additionally parameters
named K, or KN (for any value of N), should be exact, non-negative
integers.  (XXX Types of Lisp Object XXX, for a list of Kernel object
types.)  Parameters with other sorts of names are discussed
specifically in the description of the combiner.  In some sections,
features common to parameters of several combiners are described at the
beginning.

   Operative descriptions have the same format, but the word
`Applicative' is  replaced by `Operative', and `Argument' is replaced
by `Operand'.  Also Operatives always have an environment parameter
(that can be #ignore or a symbol).

2 Interpreter
*************

This section describes the `klisp', a Kernel Programming Language
stand-alone interpreter.

2.1 Invocation
==============

`klisp' is invoked like this:
     klisp [options] [script]

2.2 Description
===============

`klisp' is a stand-alone klisp interpreter for the Kernel Programming
Language.  It loads and evaluates Kernel programs in textual source
form.  `klisp' can be used as a batch interpreter and also
interactively.  The given `options' (*note Command Line Options::) are
evaluated and then the klisp program in file `script' is loaded and
evaluated.  All evaluations mentioned, including the initialization
that is described below, take place in the same (initially) standard
environment. All values that result from these evaluation are
discarded, but if the `root-continuation' or `error-continuation' are
passed a value, the evaluation of `options' is interrupted and `klisp'
terminates.  *Note Exit Status: Interpreter Exit Status, for a
description of the exit status in each case.

   The string `script' together with all arguments are available as a
list of strings via the applicative `get-script-arguments'.  If these
arguments contain spaces or other characters special to the shell, then
they should be quoted (but note that the quotes will be removed by the
shell).  The complete command line, including the name of the
interpreter, options, the script, and its arguments are available as a
list of strings via the applicative `get-interpreter-arguments'.

   At the very beginning, before even handling the command line,
`klisp' reads and evaluates the contents of the environment variable
`KLISP_INIT', if it is defined.  To use an init file, just define
`KLISP_INIT' to the following form: `(load "/path/to/init-file")'.
Notice that `klisp' expects exactly one expression in `KLISP_INIT', if
it is defined.  So it is an error to have no expressions or more than
one in `KLISP_INIT'.  The same is true of the argument to the `-e'
option, as both are implemented in terms of `string-eval'.

   In interactive mode, `klisp' prompts the user, reads expressions
from the standard input, and evaluates them as they are read. The
default prompt is "klisp> ".

2.3 Options
===========

Options start with `-' and are described below. You can use `--' to
signal the end of options. If no arguments are given, then `-v'  `-i'
is assumed when the standard input is a terminal; otherwise, `-' is
assumed.  If no SCRIPT, or option `-e' or `-l' is given, `-i' is
assumed.

`-'
     load and execute the standard input as a file, that is, not
     interactively, even when the standard input is a terminal.  .TP

`-e EXPR'
     evaluate expression EXPR.  You need to quote EXPR if it contains
     spaces, quotes, or other characters special to the shell.

`-i'
     enter interactive mode after SCRIPT is executed.

`-l NAME'
     evaluate `(load "name")' before SCRIPT is executed.  Typically
     used to do environment initialization.

`-r NAME'
     evaluate `(require "name")' before SCRIPT is executed. Typically
     used to load libraries.

`-v'
     show version and copyright information.


2.4 Exit Status
===============

If the SCRIPT or `stdin' reach EOF or if there is no SCRIPT,
`EXIT_SUCCESS' is returned.  If the ERROR-CONTINUATION is passed an
object during init, arguments or script evaluation `EXIT_FAILURE' is
returned.  If the ROOT-CONTINUATION is passed an object, `klisp' tries
to convert the value passed to the ROOT-CONTINUATION to an exit status
as follows:

`integer'
     If the value is an integer it is used as exit status.

`boolean'
     If the value is a boolean then `EXIT_SUCCESS' is returned for `#t'
     and `EXIT_FAILURE' for `#f'.

`inert'
     If the value is inert, then `EXIT_SUCCESS' is returned.

`else'
     In any other case `EXIT_FAILURE' is returned.

2.5 Environment Variables
=========================

The following environment variables affect the behaviour of `klisp'

`KLISP_INIT'
     A Kernel expression to be evaluated before any arguments to the
     interpreter.  To use an init file, just define KLISP_INIT to the
     following form `(load "/path/to/init-file")'

`KLISP_PATH'
     A semicolon separated list of templates for controlling the search
     of required files.  Each template can use the char `?' to be
     replaced by the required name at run-time.

3 Booleans
**********

The boolean data type consists of two values, which are called true and
false, and have respectively external representations `#t' and `#f'.
There are no possible mutations of either of these two values, and the
boolean type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: boolean? (boolean? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type boolean.  `boolean?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type boolean.

 -- Applicative: not? (not? boolean)
     Applicative `not?' is a predicate that returns the logical
     negation of its argument.

 -- Applicative: and? (and? . booleans)
     Applicative `and?' is a predicate that returns true unless one or
     more of its arguments are false.

 -- Applicative: or? (or? . booleans)
     Applicative `or?' is a predicate that returns false unless one or
     more of its arguments are true.

 -- Operative: $and? ($and? . <list>)
     The `$and?' operative performs a "short-circuit and" of its
     operands.  It evaluates them from left to right, until either an
     operand evaluates to false, or the end of the list is reached.  If
     the end of the list is reached (which is immediate if `<list>' is
     `nil'), the operative returns true.  If an operand evaluates to
     false, no further operand evaluations are performed, and the
     operative returns false.  If `<list>' is acyclic, and the last
     operand is evaluated, it is evaluated in a special type of tail
     context that checks that the passed value is a boolean.  If
     `<list>' is cyclic, an unbounded number of operand evaluations may
     be performed.  If any of the operands evaluates to a non-boolean
     value, an error is signaled (even if it's the last one).

 -- Operative: $or? ($or? . <list>)
     The `$or?' operative performs a "short-circuit or" of its
     operands.  It evaluates them from left to right, until either an
     operand evaluates to true, or the end of the list is reached.  If
     the end of the list is reached (which is immediate if `<list>' is
     `nil'), the operative returns false.  If an operand evaluates to
     true, no further operand evaluations are performed, and the
     operative returns true.  If `<list>' is acyclic, and the last
     operand is evaluated, it is evaluated in a special type of tail
     context that checks that the passed value is a boolean.  If
     `<list>' is cyclic, an unbounded number of operand evaluations may
     be performed.  If any of the operands evaluates to a non-boolean
     value, an error is signaled (even if it's the last one).

4 Equivalence
*************

Kernel has two general-purpose equivalence predicates (whereas R5RS
Scheme has three).  The two Kernel predicates correspond to the
abstract notions of equivalence up to mutation (`equal') and
equivalence in the presence of mutation (`eq?').

 -- Applicative: eq? (eq? . objects)
     Predicate `eq?' returns true iff all of `objects' are effectively
     the same object, even in the presence of mutation.

 -- Applicative: equal? (equal? . objects)
     Predicate `equal?' returns true iff all of `objects' "look" the
     same as long as nothing is mutated.  This is a weaker predicate
     than `eq?'; that is, `equal?' must return true whenever `eq?'
     would return true.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Symbols,  Next: Control,  Prev: Equivalence,  Up: Top

5 Symbols
*********

Two symbols are eq? iff they have the same external representation.
Symbols are immutable, and the symbol type is encapsulated.  The
external representations of symbols are usually identifiers.  However,
symbols with other external representations may be created.  Symbols
whose external representation is enclosed within "|" (that is "| ...
|") can contain any character supported by klisp, "|" and "\" can be
included by escaping them with a leading "\" (that is "\|" and "\\").
Characters in symbols can also be specified with a unicode hex escape
by using the syntax "\x<hex codepoint>;".  This works whether using the
"| ... |" syntax or not.

 -- Applicative: symbol? (symbol? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type symbol.  `symbol?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type symbol.

 -- Applicative: symbol->string (symbol->string symbol)
     Applicative `symbol->string' returns the name of `symbol' as a
     string.  The string returned is immutable.

 -- Applicative: string->symbol (string->symbol string)
     Applicative `string->symbol' returns the symbol with name
     `string'.  The symbol is always interned, which means, that it is
     always the case that:
          (eq? <symbol> (string->symbol (symbol->string <symbol>)))
               => #t
       `string->symbol' can create symbols whose external
     representation aren't identifiers.  klisp uses the r7rs external
     representation for such symbols and so all symbols can be written
     and read back.


File: klisp.info,  Node: Control,  Next: Pairs and lists,  Prev: Symbols,  Up: Top

6 Control
*********

The inert data type is provided for use with control combiners.  It
consists of a single immutable value, having external representation
`#inert'.  The inert type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: inert? (inert? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type inert. `inert?' returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type inert.

 -- Operative: $if ($if <test> <consequent> <alternative>)
     The `$if' operative first evaluates `<test>' in the dynamic
     environment.  If the result is not of type boolean, an error is
     signaled.  If the result is true, `<consequent>' is then evaluated
     in the dynamic environment as a tail context.  Otherwise,
     `<alternative>' is evaluated in the dynamic environment as a tail
     context.

 -- Operative: $sequence ($sequence . <objects>)
     The `$sequence' operative evaluates the elements of the list
     `<objects>' in the dynamic environment, one at a time from left to
     right.  If `<objects>' is a cyclic list, element evaluation
     continues indefinitely, with elements in the cycle being evaluated
     repeatedly.  If `<objects>' is a nonempty finite list, its last
     element is evaluated as a tail context.  If `<objects>' is the
     empty list, the result is inert.

 -- Operative: $cond ($cond . <clauses>)
     `<clauses>' should be a list of clause expressions, each of the
     form `(<test> . <body>)', where body is a list of expressions.

     The following equivalences define the behaviour of the `$cond'
     operative:
          ($cond) == #inert
          ($cond (<test> . <body>) . <clauses>) ==
            ($if <test> ($sequence . <body>) ($cond . <clauses>))

 -- Applicative: for-each (for-each applicative . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list of lists; if there are two or
     more, they should all be the same length. If lists is empty, or if
     all of its elements are not lists of the same length, an error is
     signaled.

     `for-each' behaves identically to `map', except that instead of
     accumulating and returning a list of the results of the
     element-wise applications, the results of the applications are
     discarded and the result returned by `for-each' is inert.

 -- Applicative: string-for-each (string-for-each applicative . strings)
 -- Applicative: vector-for-each (vector-for-each applicative. vectors)
 -- Applicative: bytevector-for-each (bytevector-for-each applicative .
          bytevectors)
     `strings', `vectors', or `bytevectors' should be non-empty lists
     of the corresponding type and all elements should be of the same
     length.

     These applicatives behave as `for-each' except that the list of
     elements passed to `applicative' are the n-th chars, objects, or
     uint8s of the strings, vectors or bytevectors passed as arguments.

     SOURCE NOTE: These are taken from r7rs.

 -- Operative: $when ($when <test> . <body>)
 -- Operative: $unless ($unless <test> . <body>)
     `body' should be a list of expressions.

     These operatives behave as one-armed `$if's with an implicit
     `$sequence', except that they always discard the last value and
     the result returned is inert.

     So both `$when', and `$unless' evaluate `<test>' in the dynamic
     environment.  If the result is non boolean an error is signaled.
     In `$when' if the result is false and in `$unless' if the result
     is true, the expressions in `<body>' are not evaluated and an
     inert value is returned.  Otherwise, the expressions in `<body>'
     are evaluated sequentially in the dynamic environment.  If
     `<body>' is a non cyclic list, the last expression in `<body>' is
     evaluated in a special type of tail context, that, upon receiving
     a value discards it and returns an inert value instead.  If
     `<body>' is a cyclic list, element evaluation continues
     indefinitely, with elements in the cycle being evaluated
     repeatedly.  SOURCE NOTE: These are taken from r7rs.

7 Pairs and lists
*****************

A pair is an object that refers to two other objects, called its car
and cdr.  The Kernel data type pair is encapsulated.

   The null data type consists of a single immutable value, called nil
or the empty list and having external representation `()', with or
without whitespace between the parentheses. It is immutable, and the
null type is encapsulated.

   If `a' and `d' are external representations of respectively the car
and cdr of a pair `p', then `(a . d)' is an external representation of
`p'. If the cdr of `p' is nil, then `(a)' is also an external
representation of `p'. If the cdr of `p' is a pair `p2', and `(r)' is
an external representation of `p2', then `(a r)' is an external
representation of `p'.    When a pair is output (as by write), an
external representation with the fewest parentheses is used; in the
case of a finite list, only one set of parentheses is required beyond
those used in representing the elements of the list. For example, an
object with external representation `(1 . (2 . (3 . ())))' would be
output using, modulo whitespace, external representation `(1 2 3)'.

 -- Applicative: pair? (pair? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type pair.  `pair?' returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type pair.

 -- Applicative: null? (null? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type null.  `null?' returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type null.

 -- Applicative: immutable-pair? (immutable-pair? objects)
 -- Applicative: mutable-pair? (mutable-pair? objects)
     The primitive type predicates for types immutable pair and mutable
     pair.  These return true iff all the objects in `objects' are of
     type immutable pair or mutable pair respectively.

     SOURCE NOTE: these aren't provided in the Kernel report, but added
     for convenience.  These can be implemented in standard kernel by
     using guards.

 -- Applicative: cons (cons object1 object2)
     A new mutable pair object is constructed and returned, whose car
     and cdr referents are respectively `object1' and `object2'.  No
     two objects returned by different calls to cons are `eq?' to each
     other.

 -- Applicative: set-car! (set-car! pair object)
 -- Applicative: set-cdr! (set-cdr! pair object)
     `pair' should be a mutable pair.

     These applicatives set the referent of, respectively, the car
     reference or the cdr reference of `pair' to `object'.  The result
     of the expression is inert.

 -- Applicative: copy-es-immutable! (copy-es-immutable object)
     The short description of this applicative is that it returns an
     object `equal?' to `object' with an immutable evaluation
     structure. The "-es-" in the name is short for "evaluation
     structure".

     The evaluation structure of an object `o' is defined to be the set
     of all pairs that can be reached by following chains of references
     from `o' without ever passing through a non-pair object. The
     evaluation structure of a non-pair object is empty.

     If `object' is not a pair, the applicative returns `object'.
     Otherwise (if `object' is a pair), the applicative returns an
     immutable pair whose car and cdr would be suitable results for
     `(copy-es-immutable (car object))' and `(copy-es-immutable (cdr
     object))', respectively.  Further, the evaluation structure of the
     returned value is isomorphic to that of `object' at the time of
     copying, with corresponding non-pair referents being `eq?'.

     NOTE: In Kernel it's undefined whether immutable pairs are copied
     or left "as is" in the result.  klisp doesn't copy immutable
     pairs, but that behaviour should not be depended upon.

 -- Applicative: list (list . objects)
     The `list' applicative returns `objects'.

     The underlying operative of `list' returns its undifferentiated
     operand tree, regardless of whether that tree is or is not a list.

 -- Applicative: list* (list* . objects)
     `objects' should be a finite nonempty list of arguments.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (list* arg1) == arg1
          (list* arg1 arg2 . args) == (cons arg1 (list* arg2 . args))

 -- Applicative: car (car pair)
 -- Applicative: cdr (cdr pair)
     These applicatives return, respectively, the car and cdr of `pair'.

 -- Applicative: caar (caar pair)
 -- Applicative: cadr (cadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdar (cdar pair)
 -- Applicative: cddr (cddr pair)
 -- Applicative: caaar (caaar pair)
 -- Applicative: caadr (caadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cadar (cadar pair)
 -- Applicative: caddr (caddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaar (cdaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdadr (cdadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cddar (cddar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdddr (cdddr pair)
 -- Applicative: caaaar (caaaar pair)
 -- Applicative: caaadr (caaadr pair)
 -- Applicative: caadar (caadar pair)
 -- Applicative: caaddr (caaddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cadaar (cadaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cadadr (cadadr pair)
 -- Applicative: caddar (caddar pair)
 -- Applicative: cadddr (cadddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaaar (cdaaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaadr (cdaadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdadar (cdadar pair)
 -- Applicative: cdaddr (cdaddr pair)
 -- Applicative: cddaar (cddaar pair)
 -- Applicative: cddadr (cddadr pair)
 -- Applicative: cdddar (cdddar pair)
 -- Applicative: cddddr (cddddr pair)
     These applicatives are compositions of `car' and `cdr', with the
     "a’s" and "d’s" in the same order as they would appear if all the
     individual "car’s" and "cdr’s" were written out in prefix order.
     Arbitrary compositions up to four deep are provided. There are
     twenty-eight of these applicatives in all.

 -- Applicative: make-list (make-list length [fill])
     `length' shoulde be an exact non-negative integer.

     Applicative `make-list' creates a new mutable acyclic list of
     length `length', with all pairs having `fill' in their cars.  If
     no value is provided for `fill', `#inert' is used.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: list-copy (list-copy list)
     Applicative `list-copy' creates a new mutable copy of `list'.
     That is, the returned list has the same list metrics as `list' and
     the cars in the returned list are initially `eq?' to the
     corresponding cars in `list'.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: reverse (reverse list)
     `list' should be an acyclic list.

     Applicative `reverse' makes a mutable copy of list but with the
     reverse order.  That is, the returned list has the same number of
     pairs as `list' and the cars in the returned list are initially
     `eq?' to the corresponding cars in `list' but starting from the
     end and going backwards.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: get-list-metrics (get-list-metrics object)
     By definition, an improper list is a data structure whose objects
     are its start together with all objects reachable from the start by
     following the cdr references of pairs, and whose internal
     references are just the cdr references of its pairs.  Every
     object, of whatever type, is the start of an improper list.  If
     the start is not a pair, the improper list consists of just that
     object.  The acyclic prefix length of an improper list `L' is the
     number of pairs of `L' that a naive traversal of `L' would visit
     only once. The cycle length of `L' is the number of pairs of `L'
     that a naive traversal would visit repeatedly. Two improper lists
     are structurally isomorphic iff they have the same acyclic prefix
     length and cycle length and, if they are terminated by non-pair
     objects rather than by cycles, the non-pair objects have the same
     type.  Applicative `get-list-metrics' constructs and returns a
     list of exact integers of the form `(p n a c)', where `p', `n',
     `a', and `c' are, respectively, the number of pairs in, the number
     of nil objects in, the acyclic prefix length of, and the cycle
     length of, the improper list starting with `object'. `n' is either
     `0' or `1', `a + c = p', and `n' and `c' cannot both be non-zero.
     If `c = 0', the improper list is acyclic; if `n = 1', the improper
     list is a finite list; if `n = c = 0', the improper list is not a
     list; if `a = c = 0', `object' is not a pair.

 -- Applicative: list-tail (list-tail object k)
     `object' must be the start of an improper list containing at least
     `k' pairs.

     The `list-tail' applicative follows `k' cdr references starting
     from `object'.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (list-tail object 0) == object
          (list-tail object (+ k 1)) == (list-tail (cdr object) k)

 -- Applicative: encycle! (encycle! object k1 k2)
     The improper list starting at `object' must contain at least `k1 +
     k2' pairs.

     If `k2 = 0', the applicative does nothing. If `k2 > 0', the
     applicative mutates the improper list starting at `object' to have
     acyclic prefix length `k1' and cycle length `k2', by setting the
     cdr of the `(k1+k2)'th pair in the list to refer to the `(k1 +
     1)'th pair in the list.  The result returned by `encycle!' is
     inert.

 -- Applicative: map (map applicative . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list of lists; if there are two or
     more, they must all have the same length.

     The map applicative applies `applicative' element-wise to the
     elements of the lists in lists (i.e., applies it to a list of the
     first elements of the lists, to a list of the second elements of
     the lists, etc.), using the dynamic environment from which map was
     called, and returns a list of the results, in order. The
     applications may be performed in any order, as long as their
     results occur in the resultant list in the order of their
     arguments in the original lists.  If `lists' is a cyclic list,
     each argument list to which `applicative' is applied is
     structurally isomorphic to `lists'.  If any of the elements of
     `lists' is a cyclic list, they all must be, or they wouldn’t all
     have the same length.  Let `a1...an' be their acyclic prefix
     lengths, and `c1...cn' be their cycle lengths.  The acyclic prefix
     length `a' of the resultant list will be the maximum of the `ak',
     while the cycle length `c' of the resultant list will be the least
     common multiple of the `ck'.  In the construction of the result,
     `applicative' is called exactly `a + c' times.

 -- Applicative: length (length object)
     Applicative `length' returns the (exact) improper-list length of
     `object'.  That is, it returns the number of consecutive cdr
     references that can be followed starting from `object'.  If
     `object' is not a pair, it returns zero; if `object' is a cyclic
     list, it returns positive infinity.

 -- Applicative: list-ref (list-ref object k)
     The `list-ref' applicative returns the `car' of the object
     obtained by following `k' cdr references starting from `object'.

     NOTE: In the current report, object is required to be a list. In
     klisp, for now, we prefer the behaviour presented here, as it is
     more in line with the applicative `list-tail'.  That is, we define
     `list-ref' by the following equivalence:
          (list-ref object k) == (car (list-tail object k))

 -- Applicative: append (append . lists)
     Here, all the elements of `lists' except the last element (if any)
     must be acyclic lists.  The `append' applicative returns a freshly
     allocated list of the elements of all the specified `lists', in
     order, except that if there is a last specified element of
     `lists', it is not copied, but is simply referenced by the cdr of
     the preceding pair (if any) in the resultant list.  If `lists' is
     cyclic, the cycle of the result list consists of just the elements
     of the lists specified in the cycle in `lists'. In this case, the
     acyclic prefix length of the result is the sum of the lengths of
     the lists specified in the acyclic prefix of `lists', and the
     cycle length of the result is the sum of the lengths of the lists
     specified in the cycle of `lists'.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (append) == ()
          (append h) == h
          (append () h . t) == (append h . t)
          (append (cons a b) h . t) == (cons a (append b h . t))

 -- Applicative: list-neighbors (list-neighbors list)
     The `list-neighbors' applicative constructs and returns a list of
     all the consecutive sublists of `list' of length 2, in order.  If
     `list' is nil, the result is nil.  If `list' is non-nil, the
     length of the result is one less than the length of `list'. If
     `list' is cyclic, the result is structurally isomorphic to it
     (i.e., has the same acyclic prefix length and cycle length).

     For example:
          (list-neighbors (list 1 2 3 4)) => ((1 2) (2 3) (3 4))

 -- Applicative: filter (filter applicative list)
     Applicative `filter' passes each of the elements of `list' as an
     argument to `applicative', one at a time in no particular order,
     using a fresh empty environment for each call.  The result of each
     call to `applicative' must be boolean, otherwise an error is
     signaled.  `filter' constructs and returns a list of all elements
     of `list' on which `applicative' returned true, in the same order
     as in `list'.  `applicative' is called exactly as many times as
     there are pairs in `list'.  The resultant list has a cycle
     containing exactly those elements accepted by `applicative' that
     were in the cycle of `list'; if there were no such elements, the
     result is acyclic.

 -- Applicative: assoc (assoc object pairs [eq-pred?])
     Applicative `assoc' returns the first element of `pairs' whose car
     is `eq-pred?' to `object'.  If there is no such element in
     `pairs', nil is returned.  If `eq-pred?' is not supplied it
     defaults to `equal?'.  SOURCE NOTE: the optional eq-pred? argument
     is from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: member? (member? object list [eq-pred?])
     Applicative `member?' is a predicate that returns true iff some
     element of `list' is `eq-pred?' to `object'.  If `eq-pred?' is not
     supplied, it defaults to `equal?'.  SOURCE NOTE: the optional
     eq-pred? argument is from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: finite-list? (finite-list? . objects)
     This is the type predicate for type finite-list.  `finite-list?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are acyclic lists.

 -- Applicative: countable-list? (countable-list? . objects)
     This is the type predicate for type list.  `countable-list?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are lists.

 -- Applicative: reduce (reduce list binary identity [precycle incycle
          postcycle])
     `binary' should be an applicative. If the short form is used,
     `list' should be an acyclic. If the long form is used, `precycle',
     `incycle', and `postcycle' should be applicatives.

     If `list' is empty, applicative `reduce' returns `identity'.  If
     `list' is nonempty but acyclic, applicative `reduce' uses binary
     operation `binary' to merge all the elements of `list' into a
     single object, using any associative grouping of the elements.
     That is, the sequence of objects initially found in `list' is
     repeatedly decremented in length by applying `binary' to a list of
     any two consecutive objects, replacing those two objects with the
     result at the point in the sequence where they occurred; and when
     the sequence contains only one object, that object is returned.
     If `list' is cyclic, the long form must be used.  The elements of
     the cycle are passed, one at a time (but just once for each
     position in the cycle), as arguments to unary applicative
     `precycle'; the finite, cyclic sequence of results from `precycle'
     is reduced using binary applicative `incycle'; and the result from
     reducing the cycle is passed as an argument to unary applicative
     `postcycle'. Binary operation `binary' is used to reduce the
     sequence consisting of the elements of the acyclic prefix of
     `list' followed by the result returned by `postcycle'. The only
     constraint on the order of calls to the applicatives is that each
     call must be made before its result is needed (thus, parts of the
     reduction of the acyclic prefix may occur before the contribution
     from the cycle has been completed).

     Each call to `binary', `precycle', `incycle', or `postcycle' uses
     the dynamic environment of the call to `reduce'.

     If `list' is acyclic with length `n >= 1', `binary' is called `n -
     1' times.  If `list' is cyclic with acyclic prefix length `a' and
     cycle length `c', `binary' is called `a' times; `precycle', `c'
     times; `incycle', `c - 1' times; and `postcycle', once.

 -- Applicative: append! (append! . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list; its first element must be an
     acyclic nonempty list, and all of its elements except the last
     element (if any) must be acyclic lists.

     The `append!' applicative sets the cdr of the last pair in each
     nonempty list argument to refer to the next non-nil argument,
     except that if there is a last non-nil argument, it isn’t mutated.
     It is an error for any two of the list arguments to have the same
     last pair.  The result returned by this applicative is inert.

     The following equivalences hold:
          (append! v) == #inert
          (append! u v . w) == ($sequence (append! u v) (append! u . w))

 -- Applicative: copy-es (copy-es object)
     Briefly, applicative `copy-es' returns an object initially
     `equal?' to `object' with a freshly constructed evaluation
     structure made up of mutable pairs.  If `object' is not a pair,
     the applicative returns `object'.  If `object' is a pair, the
     applicative returns a freshly constructed pair whose car and cdr
     would be suitable results for `(copy-es (car object))' and
     `(copy-es (cdr object))', respectively.  Further, the evaluation
     structure of the returned value is structurally isomorphic to that
     of `object' at the time of copying, with corresponding non-pair
     referents being `eq?'.

 -- Applicative: assq (assq object pairs)
     Applicative `assq' returns the first element of `pairs' whose car
     is `eq?' to `object'.  If there is no such element in `pairs', nil
     is returned.

 -- Applicative: memq? (memq? object list)
     Applicative `memq?' is a predicate that returns true iff some
     element of `list' is `eq?' to `object'.

8 Environments
**************

An environment consists of a set of bindings, and a list of zero or
more references to other environments called its parents.  Changing the
set of bindings of an environment, or setting the referent of the
reference in a binding, is a mutation of the environment. (Changing the
parent list, or a referent in the list, would be a mutation of the
environment too, but there is no facility provided to do it.) The
Kernel data type environment is encapsulated.  Among other things,
there is no facility provided for enumerating all the variables
exhibited by an environment (which is not required, after all, to be a
finite set), and no facility for identifying the parents of an
environment.  Two environments are `equal?' iff they are `eq?'.

   An auxiliary data type used by combiners that perform binding is
ignore. The ignore type consists of a single immutable value, having
external representation `#ignore'.  The ignore type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: environment? (environment? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type environment.  `environment?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type
     environment.

 -- Applicative: ignore? (ignore? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type ignore.  `ignore?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type ignore.

 -- Applicative: eval (eval expression environment)
     The `eval' applicative evaluates `expression' in `environment', as
     a tail context, returning the resulting value.

 -- Applicative: make-environment (make-environment . environments)
     The applicative constructs and returns a new environment, with
     initially no local bindings, and parent environments the
     environments listed in `environments'. The constructed environment
     internally stores its list of parents independent of the
     first-class list `environments', so that subsequent mutation of
     `environments' will not change the parentage of the constructed
     environment. If the provided list `environments' is cyclic, the
     constructed environment will still check each of its parents at
     most once, and signal an error if no binding is found locally or
     in any of the parents.  No two objects returned by different calls
     to `make-environment' are `eq?' to each other.

 -- Operative: $define! ($define! <definiend> <expression>)
     `<definiend>' should be a formal parameter tree, as described
     below; otherwise, an error is signaled.

     The `$define!' operative evaluates `<expression>' in the dynamic
     environment and matches `<definiend>' to the result in the dynamic
     environment, binding each symbol in definiend in the dynamic
     environment to the corresponding part of the result; the matching
     process will be further described below. The ancestors of the
     dynamic environment, if any, are unaffected by the matching
     process, as are all bindings, local to the dynamic environment, of
     symbols not in `<definiend>'.  The result returned by `$define!' is
     inert.

     A formal parameter tree has the following context-free structure:
          ptree:: symbol | #ignore | () | (ptree . ptree)

     That is, a formal parameter tree is either a symbol, or ignore, or
     nil, or a pair whose car and cdr referents are formal parameter
     trees.  A formal parameter tree must also be acyclic, and no one
     symbol can occur more than once in it.  It is not an error for a
     pair in the tree to be reachable from the root by more than one
     path, as long as there is no cycle; but if any particular symbol
     were reachable from the root by more than one path, that would
     count as occurring more than once.  Thus, if a pair is reachable
     by more than one path, there must be no symbols reachable from it.

     Matching of a formal parameter tree `t' to an object `o' in an
     environment `e' proceeds recursively as follows.  If the matching
     process fails, an error is signaled.
        * If `t' is a symbol, then `t' is bound to `o' in `e'.

        * If `t' is `#ignore', no action is taken.

        * If `t' is nil, then `o' must be nil (else matching fails).

        * If `t' is a pair, then `o' must be a pair (else matching
          fails). The car of `t' is matched to the car of `o' in `e',
          and the cdr of `t' is matched to the cdr of `o' in `e'.

 -- Operative: $let ($let <bindings> . <objects>)
     `<bindings>' should be a finite list of
     formal-parameter-tree/expression pairings, each of the form
     `(formals expression)', where each `formals' is a formal
     parameter, and no symbol occurs in more than one of the `formals'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($let ((form1 exp1) ... (formn expn)) . objects) ==
            (($lambda (form1 ... formn) . objects) exp1 ... expn)

     Thus, the `expk' are first evaluated in the dynamic environment,
     in any order; then a child environment `e' of the dynamic
     environment is created, with the `formk' matched in `e' to the
     results of the evaluations of the `expk'; and finally the
     subexpressions of `objects' are evaluated in `e' from left to
     right, with the last (if any) evaluated as a tail context, or if
     `objects' is empty the result is inert.

 -- Operative: $binds? ($binds? <exp> . <symbols>)
     Operative `$binds' evaluates `<exp>' in the dynamic environment;
     call the result `env'.  `env' must be an environment.  The
     operative is a predicate that returns true iff all its later
     operands, `<symbols>', are visibly bound in `env'.

 -- Applicative: get-current-environment (get-current-environment)
     The `get-current-environment' applicative returns the dynamic
     environment in which it is called.

 -- Applicative: make-kernel-standard-environment
          (make-kernel-standard-environment)
     The `make-kernel-standard-environment' applicative returns a
     standard environment; that is, a child of the ground environment
     with no local bindings.

 -- Operative: $let* ($let* <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' should be a finite list of
     formal-parameter-tree/expression pairings, each of the form
     `(formals expression)', where each `formals' is a formal parameter
     tree; `<body>' should be a list of expressions.

     The following equivalences hold:

          ($let* () . body) == ($let () . body)

          ($let* ((form exp) . bindings) . body) ==
            ($let ((form exp)) ($let* bindings . body))

 -- Operative: $letrec ($letrec <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:
          ($letrec ((form1 exp1) ... (formn expn)) . body) ==
            ($let () ($define! (form1 ... formn) (list exp1 ... expn)) . body)

 -- Operative: $letrec* ($letrec* <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let*'.

     The following equivalences hold:
          ($letrec* () . body) == ($letrec () . body)

          ($letrec* ((form exp) . bindings) . body) ==
            ($letrec ((form exp)) ($letrec* bindings . body))

 -- Operative: $let-redirect ($let-redirect <exp> <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($let-redirect exp ((form1 exp1) ... (formn . body) expn)) ==
            ((eval (list $lambda (form1 ... formn) body) exp) expn ... expn)

 -- Operative: $let-safe ($let-safe <bindings> . <body>)
     `<bindings>' and `<body>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($let-safe bindings . body) ==
            ($let-redirect (make-kernel-standard-environment) bindings . body)

 -- Operative: $remote-eval ($remote-eval <exp1> <exp2>)
     Operative `$remote-eval' evaluates `<exp2>' in the dynamic
     environment, then evaluates `<exp1>' as a tail context in the
     environment that must result from the first evaluation.

 -- Operative: $bindings->environment ($bindings->environment .
          <bindings>)
     `<bindings>' should be as described for `$let'.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($bindings->environment . bindings) ==
            ($let-redirect (make-environment) bindings (get-current-environment))

 -- Applicative: eval-string (eval-string string environment)
     `string' should be the external representation of a single object.
     If none or more than one external representation is found in
     `string' then an error is signaled.

     Applicative `eval-string' reads an external representation from
     string, and evaluates the resulting object in `environment', as a
     tail context, returning the resulting value.

 -- Operative: $set! ($set! <exp1> <formals> <exp2>)
     `<formals>' should be as described for the `$define!' operative.
     The `$set!' operative evaluates `<exp1>' and `<exp2>' in the
     dynamic environment; call the results `env' and `obj'.  If `env'
     is not an environment, an error is signaled.  Then the operative
     matches `<formals>' to `obj' in environment `env'.  Thus, the
     symbols of `<formals>' are bound in `env' to the corresponding
     parts of `obj'.  The result returned by `$set!' is inert.

 -- Operative: $provide! ($provide! <symbols> . <body>)
     `<symbols>' must be a finite list of symbols, containing no
     duplicates.  `<body>' must be a finite list.

     The `$provide!' operative constructs a child `e' of the dynamic
     environment `d'; evaluates the elements of `<body>' in `e', from
     left to right, discarding all of the results; and exports all of
     the bindings of symbols in `<symbols>' from `e' to `d', i.e.,
     binds each symbol in `d' to the result of looking it up in `e'.
     The result returned by `$provide!'  is inert.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($provide!  symbols . body) ==
          ($define!  symbols ($let () ($sequence . body) (list . symbols)))

 -- Operative: $import! ($import! <exp> . <symbols>)
     `<symbols>' must be a list of symbols.

     The `$import!' operative evaluates `<exp>' in the dynamic
     environment; call the result `env'. `env' must be an environment.
     Each distinct symbol `s' in `<symbols>' is evaluated in `env', and
     `s' is bound in the dynamic environment to the result of this
     evaluation.

     The following equivalence holds:

          ($import! exp . symbols) ==
          ($define! symbols ($remote-eval (list symbols) exp))

9 Combiners
***********

There are two types of combiners in Kernel, operative and applicative.
Both types are encapsulated. All combiners are immutable.  Two
applicatives are `eq?' iff their underlying combiners are `eq?'.
However, `eq?'-ness of operatives is only constrained by the general
rules for `eq?', which leave considerable leeway for variation between
implementations.  klisp only considers `eq?' those operatives
constructed by the same call to a constructor (e.g. `$vau').  Two
combiners are `equal?' iff they are `eq?'.

 -- Applicative: operative? (operative? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type operative. `operative?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type
     operative.

 -- Applicative: applicative? (applicative? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type applicative.  `applicative?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type
     applicative.

 -- Operative: $vau ($vau <formals> <eformal> . <objects>)
     `<formals>' should be a formal parameter tree; `<eformal>' should
     be either a symbol or `#ignore'.  If `<formals>' does not have the
     correct form for a formal parameter tree, or if `<eformal>' is a
     symbol that also occurs in `<formals>', an error is signaled.

     A `vau' expression evaluates to an operative; an operative created
     in this way is said to be compound. The environment in which the
     `vau' expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the
     compound operative, called the compound operative’s static
     environment.  `<formals>' and `<objects>' are copied as by
     `copy-es-immutable' and the copies are stored as part of the
     operative being constructed.  This avoids problem if these
     structures are later mutated.

     When the compound operative created by `$vau' is later called with
     an object and an environment, here called respectively the operand
     tree and the dynamic environment, the following happens:

       1. A new, initially empty environment is created, with the static
          environment as its parent. This will be called the local
          environment.

       2. A stored copy of the formal parameter tree formals is matched
          in the local environment to the operand tree, locally binding
          the symbols of formals to the corresponding parts of the
          operand tree.  eformal is matched to the dynamic environment;
          that is, if eformal is a symbol then that symbol is bound in
          the local environment to the dynamic environment.

       3. A stored copy of the expressions is evaluated sequentially
          from left to right, with the last (if any) evaluated as a
          tail context, or if the list of expressions is empty, the
          result is inert.

     NOTE: Because compound operatives are not a distinct type in
     Kernel, they are covered by the encapsulation of type operative.
     In particular, an implementation of Kernel cannot provide a
     feature that supports extracting the static environment of any
     given compound operative, nor that supports determining whether or
     not a given operative is compound.

 -- Applicative: wrap (wrap combiner)
     The `wrap' applicative returns an applicative whose underlying
     combiner is `combiner'.

 -- Applicative: unwrap (unwrap applicative)
     The `unwrap' applicative returns the underlying combiner of
     `applicative'.

 -- Operative: $lambda ($lambda <formals> . <objects>)
     `<formals>' should be a formal parameter tree.

     The `$lambda' operative is defined by the following equivalence:
          ($lambda formals . objects) ==
            (wrap ($vau formals #ignore . objects))

 -- Applicative: apply (apply applicative object [environment])
     Applicative `apply' combines the underlying combiner of
     `applicative' with `object' in a tail context with dynamic
     environment `environment' (if the long form is used) or in an
     empty environment (if the short form is used).

     The following equivalences hold:
          (apply applicative object environment) ==
            (eval (cons (unwrap applicative) object) environment)

          (apply applicative object) ==
            (apply applicative object (make-environment))

 -- Applicative: map (map applicative . lists)
     `lists' must be a nonempty list of lists; if there are two or
     more, they must all have the same length. If `lists' is empty, or
     if all of its elements are not lists of the same length, an error
     is signaled.

     The `map' applicative applies `applicative' element-wise to the
     elements of the lists in `lists' (i.e., applies it to a list of
     the first elements of the `lists', to a list of the second
     elements of the `lists', etc.), using the dynamic environment from
     which `map' was called, and returns a list of the results, in
     order. The applications may be performed in any order, as long as
     their results occur in the resultant list in the order of their
     arguments in the original `lists'.  If `lists' is a cyclic list,
     each argument list to which `applicative' is applied is
     structurally isomorphic to `lists'.  If any of the elements of
     `lists' is a cyclic list, they all must be, or they wouldn’t all
     have the same length.  Let `a1...an' be their acyclic prefix
     lengths, and `c1...cn' be their cycle lengths.  The acyclic prefix
     length `a' of the resultant list will be the maximum of the `ak',
     while the cycle length `c' of the resultant list will be the least
     common multiple of the `ck'.  In the construction of the result,
     applicative is called exactly `a + c' times.

 -- Applicative: string-map (string-map applicative . strings)
 -- Applicative: vector-map (vector-map applicative . vectors)
 -- Applicative: bytevector-map (bytevector-map applicative .
          bytevectors)
     `strings', `vectors', or `bytevectors' should be non-empty lists
     of the corresponding type and all elements should be of the same
     length.

     These applicatives behave as `map' except that the list of
     elements passed to `applicative' are the n-th chars, objects, or
     uint8s of the strings, vectors or bytevectors passed as arguments.

     SOURCE NOTE: These are taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: combiner? (combiner? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type combiner. `combiner?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type combiner
     (i.e. applicative or operative).

10 Continuations
****************

A continuation is a plan for all future computation, parameterized by a
value to be provided, and contingent on the states of all mutable data
structures (which notably may include environments). When the Kernel
evaluator is invoked, the invoker provides a continuation to which the
result of the evaluation will normally be returned.

   For example, when `$if' evaluates its test operand, the continuation
provided for the result expects to be given a boolean value; and,
depending on which boolean it gets, it will evaluate either the
consequent or the alternative operand as a tail context — that is, the
continuation provided for the result of evaluating the selected operand
is the same continuation that was provided for the result of the call
to `$if'.

   A Kernel program may sometimes capture a continuation; that is,
acquire a reference to it as a first-class object. The basic means of
continuation capture is applicative `call/cc'.  Given a first-class
continuation `c', a combiner can be constructed that will abnormally
pass its operand tree to `c' (as opposed to the normal return of values
to continuations). In the simplest case, the abnormally passed value
arrives at `c' as if it had been normally returned to `c'. In general,
continuations bypassed by the abnormal pass may have entry/exit guards
attached to them, and these guards can intercept the abnormal pass
before it reaches `c'.  Each entry/exit guard consists of a selector
continuation, which designates which abnormal passes the guard will
intercept, and an interceptor applicative that performs the
interception when selected.

   Continuations are immutable, and are `equal?' iff `eq?'.  The
continuation type is encapsulated.

 -- Applicative: continuation? (continuation? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type continuation.
     `continuation?' returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are
     of type continuation.

 -- Applicative: call/cc (call/cc combiner)
     Calls `combiner' in the dynamic environment as a tail context,
     passing as sole operand to it the continuation to which `call/cc'
     would normally return its result.  (That is, constructs such a
     combination and evaluates it in the dynamic environment.)

 -- Applicative: extend-continuation (extend-continuation continuation
          applicative [environment])
     The `extend-continuation' applicative constructs and returns a new
     child of `continuation' that, when it normally receives a value v,
     calls the underlying combiner of `applicative' with dynamic
     environment `environment' (or an empty environment if none was
     specified) and operand tree `v', the result of the call normally
     to be returned to `continuation'.

     The following equivalnece defines the short version:
          (extend-continuation c a) ==
            (extend-continuation c a (make-environment))

 -- Applicative: guard-continuation (guard-continuation entry-guards
          continuation exit-guards)
     `entry-guards' and `exit-guards' should each be a list of clauses;
     each clause should be a list of length two, whose first element is
     a continuation, and whose second element is an applicative whose
     underlying combiner is operative.

     Applicative `guard-continuation' constructs two continuations: a
     child of continuation, called the `outer continuation'; and a
     child of the `outer continuation', called the `inner
     continuation'.  The `inner continuation' is returned as the result
     of the call to `guard-continuation'.

     When the `inner continuation' normally receives a value, it passes
     the value normally to the `outer continuation'; and when the
     `outer continuation' normally receives a value, it passes the
     value normally to `continuation'. Thus, in the absence of abnormal
     passing, the inner and outer continuations each have the same
     behavior as `continuation'.

     The two elements of each guard clause are called, respectively, the
     `selector' and the `interceptor'.  The `selector' continuation is
     used in deciding whether to intercept a given abnormal pass, and
     the `interceptor' applicative is called to perform customized
     action when interception occurs.

     At the beginning of the call to `guard-continuation', internal
     copies are made of the evaluation structures of `entry-guards' and
     `exit-guards', so that the selectors and interceptors contained in
     the arguments at that time remain fixed thereafter, independent of
     any subsequent mutations to the arguments.

 -- Applicative: continuation->applicative (continuation->applicative
          continuation)
     Returns an applicative whose underlying operative abnormally passes
     its operand tree to `continuation', thus: A series of interceptors
     are selected to handle the abnormal pass, and a continuation is
     derived that will normally perform all the interceptions in
     sequence and pass some value to the destination of the originally
     abnormal pass.  The operand tree is then normally passed to the
     derived continuation.

 -- Variable: root-continuation
     This continuation is the ancestor of all other continuations. When
     it normally receives a value, it terminates the Kernel session.
     (For example, if the system is running a read-eval-print loop, it
     exits the loop.)

 -- Variable: error-continuation
     The dynamic extent of this continuation is mutually disjoint from
     the dynamic extent in which Kernel computation usually occurs
     (such as the dynamic extent in which the Kernel system would run a
     read-eval-print loop).

     When this continuation normally receives a value, it provides a
     diagnostic message to the user of the Kernel system, on the
     assumption that the received value is an attempt to describe some
     error that aborted a computation; and then resumes operation of
     the Kernel system at some point that is outside of all
     user-defined computation. (For example, if the system is running a
     read-eval-print loop, operation may resume by continuing from the
     top of the loop.)

     The diagnostic message is not made available to any Kernel
     computation, and is therefore permitted to contain information that
     violates abstractions within the system.

     When an error is signaled during a Kernel computation, the
     signaling action consists of an abnormal pass to some continuation
     in the dynamic extent of `error-continuation'.

 -- Applicative: apply-continuation (apply-continuation continuation
          object)
     Applicative `apply-continuation' converts its first argument to an
     applicative as if by `continuation->applicative', and then applies
     it as usual.

     That is:
          (apply-continuation continuation object) ==
            (apply (continuation->applicative continuation) object)

 -- Operative: $let/cc ($let/cc <symbol> . <objects>)
     A child environment `e' of the dynamic environment is created,
     containing a binding of `<symbol>' to the continuation to which
     the result of the call to `$let/cc' should normally return; then,
     the subexpressions of `<objects>' are evaluated in `e' from left
     to right, with the last (if any) evaluated as a tail context, or
     if `<objects>' is empty the result is inert.

     That is:
          ($let/cc symbol . objects) ==
            (call/cc ($lambda (symbol) . objects))

 -- Applicative: guard-dynamic-extent (guard-dynamic-extent
          entry-guards combiner exit-guards)
     This applicative extends the current continuation with the
     specified guards, and calls `combiner' in the dynamic extent of
     the new continuation, with no operands and the dynamic environment
     of the call to `guard-dynamic-extent'.

 -- Applicative: exit (exit [object])
     Applicative `exit' initiates an abnormal transfer of `object' (or
     `#inert' if `object' was not specified), to `root-continuation'.
     That is:
          (exit) == (apply-continuation root-continuation #inert)
          (exit obj) == (apply-continuation root-continuation obj)

     SOURCE NOTE: This applicative doesn't have the optional argument in
     the report.  It was added to klisp to allow a simple way to
     terminate the interpreter passing a value that is then tried to
     convert to an exit status.

11 Encapsulations
*****************

An encapsulation is an object that refers to another object, called its
content.  The Kernel data type encapsulation is encapsulated.  Two
encapsulations are `equal?' iff they are `eq?'.  Encapsulations are
immutable.

 -- Applicative: make-encapsulation-type (make-encapsulation-type)
     Returns a list of the form `(e p? d)', where `e', `p'?, and `d'
     are applicatives, as follows.  Each call to
     `make-encapsulation-type' returns different applicatives `e',
     `p?', and `d'.

        * `e' is an applicative that takes one argument, and returns a
          fresh encapsulation with the argument as content.
          Encapsulations returned on different occasions are not `eq?'.

        * `p?' is a primitive type predicate, that takes zero or more
          arguments and returns true iff all of them are encapsulations
          generated by `e'.

        * `d' is an applicative that takes one argument; if the
          argument is not an encapsulation generated by `e', an error
          is signaled, otherwise the content of the encapsulation is
          returned.

     That is, the predicate `p?' only recognizes, and the decapsulator
     `d' only extracts the content of, encapsulations created by the
     encapsulator `e' that was returned by the same call to
     `make-encapsulation-type'.

12 Promises
***********

A promise is an object that represents the potential to determine a
value.  The value may be the result of an arbitrary computation that
will not be performed until the value must be determined (constructor
`$lazy'); or, in advanced usage, the value may be determined before the
promise is constructed (constructor `memoize').

   The value determined by a promise is obtained by forcing it
(applicative `force').  A given promise cannot determine different
values on different occasions that it is forced.  Also, if a promise
determines its value by computation, and that computation has already
been completed, forcing the promise again will produce the previously
determined result without re-initiating the computation to determine it.

   The Kernel data type promise is encapsulated.

   The general rules for predicate `eq?' only require it to distinguish
promises if they can exhibit different behavior; the resulting leeway
for variation between implementations is similar, in both cause and
effect, to that for `eq?'-ness of operatives.  For example, if two
promises, constructed on different occasions, would perform the same
computation to determine their values, and that computation has no
side-effects and must always return the same value, the promises may or
may not be `eq?'.  Two promises are `equal?' iff they are `eq?'.

 -- Applicative: promise? (promise? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type promise.  `promise?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type promise.

 -- Applicative: force (force object)
     If `object' is a promise, applicative `force' returns the value
     determined by promise; otherwise, it returns `object'.

     The means used to force a promise depend on how the promise was
     constructed.  The description of each promise constructor specifies
     how to force promises constructed by that constructor.

 -- Operative: $lazy ($lazy expression)
     Operative `$lazy' constructs and returns a new object of type
     promise, representing potential evaluation of expression in the
     dynamic environment from which `$lazy' was called.

     When the promise is forced, if a value has not previously been
     determined for it, `expression' is evaluated in the dynamic
     environment of the constructing call to `$lazy'.  If, when the
     evaluation returns a result, a value is found to have been
     determined for the promise during the evaluation, the result is
     discarded in favor of the previously determined value; otherwise,
     the result is forced, and the value returned by that forcing
     becomes the value determined by the promise.

     Forcing an undetermined lazy promise (i.e., a promise constructed
     by $lazy for which no value has yet been determined) may cause a
     sequential series of evaluations, each of which returns a promise
     that is forced and thus initiates the next evaluation in the
     series.  The implementation must support series of this kind with
     unbounded length (i.e., unbounded number of sequential
     evaluations).

     Note that forcing concerns the value determined by a given promise,
     not the result of evaluating a given expression in a given
     environment. Distinct promises (judged by `eq?' represent
     different occasions of evaluation; so, even if they do represent
     evaluation of the same expression in the same environment, forcing
     one does not necessarily determine the value for the other, and
     actual evaluation will take place the first time each of them is
     forced.

 -- Applicative: memoize (memoize object)
     Applicative `memoize' constructs and returns a new object of type
     promise, representing memoization of `object'.  Whenever the
     promise is forced, it determines `object'.

 -- Operative: $delay ($delay <expression>)
     Operative `delay' behaves as the composition of `$lazy' and
     `memoize', that is:
          ($delay <expr>) == ($lazy (memoize <expr>))
     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

A keyed variable is a device that associates a non-symbolic key (in the
form of an accessor applicative) with a value depending on the context
in which lookup occurs.  Kernel provides two types of keyed variables:
dynamic & static.  Keyed Dynamic Variables use the dynamic extent as
context and Keyed Static Variables use the dynamic environment.

13.1 Keyed Dynamic Variables
============================

A keyed dynamic variable is a device that associates a non-symbolic key
(in the form of an accessor applicative) with a value depending on the
dynamic extent in which lookup occurs.

 -- Applicative: make-keyed-dynamic-variable
          (make-keyed-dynamic-variable)
     Returns a list of the form `(b a)', where `b' and `a' are
     applicatives, as follows.  Each call to
     `make-keyed-dynamic-variable' returns different `b' and `a'.

        * `b' is an applicative that takes two arguments, the second of
          which must be a combiner.  It calls its second argument with
          no operands (nil operand tree) in a fresh empty environment,
          and returns the result.

        * `a' is an applicative that takes zero arguments. If the call
          to `a' occurs within the dynamic extent of a call to `b', then
          `a' returns the value of the first argument passed to `b' in
          the smallest enclosing dynamic extent of a call to `b'. If the
          call to `a' is not within the dynamic extent of any call to
          `b', an error is signaled.

13.2 Keyed Static Variables
===========================

A keyed static variable is a device that binds data in an environment
by a non-symbolic key, where the key is an accessor applicative.

 -- Applicative: make-keyed-static-variable (make-keyed-static-variable)
     Returns a list of the form `(b a)', where `b' and `a' are
     applicatives, as follows.  Each call to
     `make-keyed-static-variable' returns different `b' and `a'.

        * `b' is an applicative that takes two arguments, the second of
          which must be an environment.  It constructs and returns a
          child-environment of its second argument, with initially no
          local bindings.

        * `a' is an applicative that takes zero arguments. If the
          dynamic environment `e' of the call to a has an improper
          ancestor that was constructed by a call to `b', then a
          returns the value of the first argument passed to `b' in the
          first such environment encountered by a depth-first traversal
          of the improper ancestors of `e'. If `e' has no improper
          ancestors constructed via `b', an error is signaled.

14 Numbers
**********

All numbers are immutable, and `equal?' iff `eq?'.  The number type is
encapsulated.

   The external representation of an undefined number is `#undefined'.
The external representation of a real with no primary value is `#real'
(but this may change in the future, the report is missing the output
representation for reals with no primary values).  All other rules for
externally representing numbers pertain only to defined numbers with
primary values.

   An external representation of a real number consists of optional
radix and/or exactness prefixes, optional sign (`+' or `-'), and
magnitude. The radix prefixes are `#b' (binary), `#o' (octal), `#d'
(decimal), and `#x' (hexadecimal); the default is decimal.  The
exactness prefixes are `#e' (exact) and `#i' (inexact); by default, the
number is inexact iff the magnitude representation uses floating point.
If both kinds of prefixes are used, they may occur in either order. The
magnitude is either `infinity'; an unsigned integer (nonempty sequence
of digits); a ratio of unsigned integers (two unsigned integers with a
`/' between, of which the second is non-zero); or a floating point
representation.  If the magnitude is `infinity', there must be an
exactness prefix and a sign, and no radix prefix.  Floating point
representation can only be used with decimal radix; it consists of
nonempty integer part, point (`.'), nonempty fraction part, and
optional exponent part.  The optional exponent part consists of an
exponent letter, and an (optionally signed) integer indicating a power
of ten by which to multiply the magnitude.  The choice of exponent
letter makes no difference in what mathematical number is indicated by
the external representation, but does indicate internal representation
precision. Exponent letters `s', `f', `d', `f' indicate preference for
successively higher internal precision - short, float, double, long.
When reading an inexact real number, exponent letter `e' accepts the
default internal precision, which must be at least double.  When
writeing an inexact real number, exponent letter `e' may be used for
the default internal precision, and must be used for any internal
number format not indicated by any of the other exponent letters.
Float and double must provide, respectively, at least as much precision
as IEEE 32-bit and 64-bit floating point standards [IE85].  For
example, `#i#xa/c' represents an inexact number using hexadecimal
notation, with signed magnitude positive five sixths (ten over twelve).
`-3.5l-2' represents an inexact number using decimal notation, with
signed magnitude negative thirty five thousandths, and requested long
precision (which must be at least IEEE 64-bit floating point).  When
reading an external representation of an inexact real, the bounds on
the resulting inexact number are chosen in accordance with the
narrow-arithmetic keyed dynamic variable.

   NOTE: in klisp, all inexact numbers are stored as IEEE 64-bit
floating point.  No bounding or robustness info is kept.

 -- Applicative: number? (number? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type number.  `number?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type number.

 -- Applicative: integer? (integer? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for number subtype integer.
     `integer?'  returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of
     type integer.

 -- Applicative: exact-integer? (exact-integer? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for number subtype exact integer.
     `exact-integer?'  returns true iff all the objects in `objects'
     are of type integer and exact.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: u8? (u8? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for number subtype exact integer
     between 0 and 255.  This is the subtype used in bytevectors.  `u8?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type integer,
     are exact, and lie between 0 and 255 inclusive.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is handy for use with bytevectors.

 -- Applicative: rational? (rational? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for number subtype rational.
     `rational?'  returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of
     type rational.

 -- Applicative: real? (real? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for number subtype real.  `real?'
     returns true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type real.

 -- Applicative: finite? (finite? . numbers)
     Predicate `finite?' returns true iff all the numbers in `numbers'
     are finite.

 -- Applicative: exact? (exact? . numbers)
     Predicate `exact?' returns true iff all the numbers in `numbers'
     are exact.

 -- Applicative: inexact? (inexact? . numbers)
     Predicate `inexact?' returns true iff all the numbers in `numbers'
     are inexact.

 -- Applicative: robust? (robust? . numbers)
     Predicate `robust?' returns true iff all the numbers in `numbers'
     are robust.

 -- Applicative: undefined? (undefined? . numbers)
     Predicate `undefined?' returns true iff all the numbers in
     `numbers' are undefined.

 -- Applicative: =? (=? . numbers)
     Applicative `=?' is a predicate that returns true iff all its
     arguments are numerically equal to each other.  If any of its
     arguments has no primary value, an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: <? (<? . reals)
 -- Applicative: <=? (<=? . reals)
 -- Applicative: >? (>? . reals)
 -- Applicative: >=? (>=? . reals)
     Each of these applicatives is a predicate that returns true iff
     every two consecutive elements of `reals' have primary values in
     the order indicated by the name of the applicative.  If any
     element of `reals' has no primary value, an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: + (+ . numbers)
     Applicative `+' returns the sum of the elements of numbers.  If
     numbers is empty, the sum of its elements is exact zero.  If a
     positive infinity is added to a negative infinity, the result has
     no primary value.  If all the elements of a cycle are zero, the
     sum of the cycle is zero.  If the acyclic sum of the elements of a
     cycle (i.e., the sum of an acyclic list containing just those
     elements) is non-zero, the sum of the cycle is positive infinity
     times the acyclic sum of the elements.  If the acyclic sum of the
     elements of a cycle is zero, but some of the elements of the cycle
     are non-zero, the sum of the cycle has no primary value.

 -- Applicative: * (* . numbers)
     Applicative `*' returns the product of the elements of numbers.
     If numbers is empty, the product of its elements is exact one.  If
     an infinity is multiplied by zero, the result has no primary
     value.  If the acyclic product of the elements of a cycle is real
     greater than one, the product of the cycle is positive infinity.
     If all the elements of a cycle are positive one, the product of
     the cycle is positive one.  If the acyclic product of the elements
     of a cycle is positive one, but some of the elements of the cycle
     are not positive one, the product of the cycle has no primary
     value.  If the acyclic product of the elements of a cycle has
     magnitude less than one, the product of the cycle is zero.  If the
     acyclic product of the elements of a cycle has magnitude greater
     than or equal to one, and is not positive real, the product of the
     cycle has no primary value.

 -- Applicative: - (- number . numbers)
     `numbers' should be a nonempty list of numbers.

     Applicative `-' returns the sum of `number' with the negation of
     the sum of `numbers'.

 -- Applicative: zero? (zero? . numbers)
     Applicative `zero?' is a predicate that returns true iff every
     element of `numbers' is zero.  For this purpose, a real number is
     zero if its primary value is zero.  If any element of numbers has
     no primary value an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: div (div real1 real2)
 -- Applicative: mod (mod real1 real2)
 -- Applicative: div-and-mod (div-and-mod real1 real2)
     For all three applicatives, if `real1' is infinite or `real2' is
     zero, an error is signaled.

     Let `n' be the greatest integer such that `real2 * n <= real1'.
     Applicative `div' returns `n'.  Applicative `mod' returns `real1 -
     (real2 * n)'.  Applicative `div-and-mod' returns a freshly
     allocated list of length two, whose first element is `n' and whose
     second element is `real1 - (real2 * n)'.

     NOTE: I'm not really sure about this description...

 -- Applicative: div0 (div0 real1 real2)
 -- Applicative: mod0 (mod0 real1 real2)
 -- Applicative: div0-and-mod0 (div0-and-mod0 real1 real2)
     For all three applicatives, if `real1' is infinite or `real2' is
     zero, an error is signaled.

     Let `n' be the greatest integer such that `real2 * n <= real1 +
     |real2/2|'.  Applicative `div0' returns `n'.  Applicative `mod0'
     returns `real1 - (real2 * n)'.  Applicative `div0-and-mod0'
     returns a freshly allocated list of length two, whose first
     element is `n' and whose second element is `real1 - (real2 * n)'.

     NOTE: I'm not really sure about this description...

 -- Applicative: positive? (positive? . reals)
 -- Applicative: negative? (negative? . reals)
     Applicative `positive?' is a predicate that returns true iff every
     element of `reals' is greater than zero. Applicative `negative?'
     is a predicate that returns true iff every element of `reals' is
     less than zero.  If any argument to either applicative has no
     primary value an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: odd? (odd? . integers)
 -- Applicative: even? (even? . integers)
     Applicative `odd?' is a predicate that returns true iff every
     element of `integers' is odd.  Applicative `even?' is a predicate
     that returns true iff every element of `integers' is even.  If any
     argument to either applicative has no primary value an error is
     signaled.

 -- Applicative: abs (abs real)
     Applicative `abs' returns the nonnegative real number with the
     same magnitude as `real'; that is, if `real' is nonnegative it
     returns `real', otherwise it returns the negation of `real'.

 -- Applicative: max (max . reals)
 -- Applicative: min (min . reals)
     If `reals' is nil, applicative `max' returns exact negative
     infinity, and applicative `min' returns exact positive infinity.
     If `reals' is non-nil, applicative `max' returns the largest
     number in `reals', and applicative `min' returns the smallest
     number in `reals'.

 -- Applicative: lcm (lcm . impints)
 -- Applicative: gcd (gcd . impints)
     `impints' should be a list of improper integers, that is, real
     numbers each of which is either an integer or an infinity.

     Applicative `lcm' returns the smallest positive improper integer
     that is an improper0integer multiple of every element of `impints'
     (that is, smallest `n >= 1' such that for every argument `nk'
     there exists `n'k' with `nk * n'k = n').  If any of the arguments
     is zero, the result of `lcm' has no primary value.  According to
     these rules, `lcm' with nil argument list returns `1', and `lcm'
     with any infinite argument returns positive infinity.

     Applicative `gcd' returns the largest positive improper integer
     such that every element of `impints' is an improper-integer
     multiple of it (that is, largest `n >= 1' such that for every
     argument `nk' there exists `n'k' with `n * n'k = nk').  `gcd' with
     nil argument list returns exact positive infinity.  If `gcd' is
     called with one or more arguments, and at least one of the
     arguments is zero, but none of the arguments is a non-zero finite
     integer, its result has no primary value.  According to these
     rules, if `gcd' is called with at least one finite non-zero
     argument, its result is the same as if all zero and infinite
     arguments were deleted.

 -- Applicative: get-real-internal-bounds (get-real-internal-bounds
          real)
 -- Applicative: get-real-exact-bounds (get-real-exact-bounds real)
     Applicative `get-real-internal-bounds' returns a freshly allocated
     list of reals `(x1 x2)', where the primary value of `x1' is the
     lower bound of `real', using the same internal representation as
     the primary value of `real', and the primary value of `x2' is the
     upper bound of `real', using the same internal representation as
     the primary value of `real'.  The `xk' are inexact iff real is
     inexact.  The `xk' are robust (i.e., tagged if the implementation
     supports such), and the bounds of each `xk' are only required to
     contain its primary value (i.e., the implementation is allowed to
     make the bounds equal to the primary value).

     Applicative `get-real-exact-bounds' returns a freshly allocated
     list of exact reals `(x1 x2)', where `x1' is not greater than the
     lower bound of `real', and `x2' is not less than the upper bound
     of `real'.

 -- Applicative: get-real-internal-primary (get-real-internal-primary
          real)
 -- Applicative: get-real-exact-primary (get-real-exact-primary real)
     If `real' is exact, both applicatives return `real'.  If `real'
     has no primary value, both applicatives signal an error.

     If `real' is inexact with a primary value, applicative
     `get-real-internal-primary' returns a real number `x0' whose
     primary value is the same as, and has the same internal format as,
     the primary value of `real'.  `x0' is robust, and its bounds are
     only required to contain its primary value.

     If `real' is inexact with a primary value, applicative
     `get-real-exact-primary' returns an exact real number `x0' within
     the exact bounds that would be returned for `real' by applicative
     `get-real-exact-bounds'.  Preferably, `x0' should be as close to
     the primary value of `real' as the implementation can reasonably
     arrange. If the implementation does not support any exact `real'
     that reasonably approximates `real', an error may be signaled.

 -- Applicative: make-inexact (make-inexact real1 real2 real3)
     Applicative `make-inexact' returns an inexact real number, as
     follows.  If `real2' is inexact, the result has the same primary
     value as `real2'; and if `real2' has no primary value, the result
     has no primary value.  The result has the same robustness as
     `real2'.  If possible, the result uses the same internal
     representation as `real2'.  If `real2' is exact, the primary value
     of the result is as close to `real2' as the implementation can
     reasonably arrange; overflow and underflow are handled as
     described in ....  The lower bound of the result is no greater than
     the lower bound of `real1', the primary value of `real2', and the
     primary value of the result.  The upper bound of the result is no
     less than the upper bound of `real3', the primary value of
     `real2', and the primary value of the result.

 -- Applicative: real->inexact (real->inexact real)
 -- Applicative: real->exact (real->exact real)
     Applicative `real->exact' behaves just as `get-real-exact-primary'.

     If `real' is inexact, applicative `real->inexact' returns `real'.
     If `real' is exact, applicative `real->inexact' returns an inexact
     real `x0' such that `real' would be a permissible result of
     passing `x0' to `real->exact'.  If the implementation does not
     support any such `x0', an error may be signaled.  Otherwise, `x0'
     is robust, and its bounds are only required to contain its primary
     value and `real'.

 -- Applicative: with-strict-arithmetic (with-strict-arithmetic boolean
          combiner)
 -- Applicative: get-string-arithmetic (get-strict-arithmetic?)
     These applicatives are the binder and accessor of the
     `strict-arithmetic' keyed dynamic variable.  When this keyed
     variable is true, various survivable but dubious arithmetic events
     signal an error - notably, operation results with no primary value,
     and over- and underflows.

 -- Applicative: / (/ number . numbers)
     `numbers' should be a nonempty list of numbers.

     Applicative `/' returns `number' divided by the product of
     `numbers'.  If the product of `numbers' is zero, an error is
     signaled.  If `number' is infinite and the product of `numbers' is
     infinite, an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: numerator (numerator rational)
 -- Applicative: denominator (denominator rational)
     These applicatives return the numerator and denominator of
     `rational', in least terms (i.e., chosen for the least positive
     denominator).  Note that if `rational' is inexact, and either of
     its bounds is not its primary value, the denominator has upper
     bound positive infinity, and the numerator must have at least one
     infinite bound (two infinite bounds if the bounds of rational
     allow values of both signs).

 -- Applicative: floor (floor real)
 -- Applicative: ceiling (ceiling real)
 -- Applicative: truncate (truncate real)
 -- Applicative: round (round real)
     Applicative `floor' returns the largest integer not greater than
     `real'.

     Applicative `ceiling' returns the smallest integer not less than
     `real'.

     Applicative `truncate' returns the integer closest to `real' whose
     absolute value is not greater than that of `real'.

     Applicative `round' returns the closest integer to `real',
     rounding to even when `real' is halfway between two integers.

 -- Applicative: rationalize (rationalize real1 real2)
 -- Applicative: simplest-rational (simplest-rational real1 real2)
     A rational number `r1' is simpler than another rational `r2' if
     `r1 = p1 / q1' and `r2 = p2 / q2', both in lowest terms, and `|p1|
     <= |p2|' and `|q1| <= |q2|'. Thus `3/5' is simpler than `4/7'. Not
     all rationals are comparable in this ordering, as for example
     `2/7' and `3/5'.  However, any interval (that contains rational
     numbers) contains a rational number that is simpler than every
     other rational number in that interval.  Note that `0 = 0/1' is
     simpler than any other rational (so that one never has to choose
     between `p/q' and `−p/q').

     For applicative `simplest-rational', let `x0' be the simplest
     rational mathematically not less than the primary value of `real1'
     and not greater than the primary value of `real2'.  If no such
     `x0' exists (because the primary value of `real1' is greater, or
     because the primary values of the arguments are equal and
     irrational), or if either argument does not have a primary value,
     an error is signaled.

     For applicative `rationalize', let `x0' be the simplest rational
     mathematical number within the interval bounded by the primary
     value of `real1' plus and minus the primary value of `real2'.  If
     no such `x0' exists (because the primary value of `real1' is
     irrational and the primary value `real2' is zero), or if either
     argument does not have a primary value, an error is signaled.

     If `real1' and `real2' are exact, the applicative (whichever it
     is) returns exact `x0'.  If one or both of `real1' and `real2' are
     inexact, the applicative returns an inexact rational approximating
     `x0' (as by `real->inexact'.  Note that an inexact result returned
     is not necessarily bounded by the primary values of the arguments;
     but the result is an approximation of `x0', which is so bounded,
     and the bounds of the result include `x0'.

 -- Applicative: sqrt (sqrt number)
     If `number' is negative, the result is undefined.

     Applicative `sqrt' returns the positive square root of number.
     The result may be inexact even if `number' is exact and the square
     root is rational.

 -- Applicative: expt (expt number1 number2)
     Applicative `expt' returns `number1' to the power of `number2'.
     If `number1' is zero, then the result is 1 if `number2' is zero
     and 0 otherwise.

 -- Applicative: exp (exp number)
 -- Applicative: log (log number)
 -- Applicative: sin (sin number)
 -- Applicative: cos (cos number)
 -- Applicative: tan (tan number)
 -- Applicative: asin (asin number)
 -- Applicative: acos (acos number)
 -- Applicative: atan (atan number1 [number2])
     These applicatives compute the usual transcendental functions.
     `log' computes the natural logarithm (not the base-10 logarithm).
     The two argument version of `atan' computes `(angle
     (make-recutangular number1 number2))' even thou klisp doesn't
     support complex numbers.

     All results may be inexact even if `number' is exact and the
     result of the transcendental function is rational.  TODO add
     intervals returned for multidefined functions (inverses and log)

 -- Applicative: string->number (string->number string [radix])
     `radix' should be an exact integer, either 2, 8, 10, or 16.
     `string' should be a string describing a number in the specified
     radix, but may contain a radix prefix to override it.  The default
     `radix', if not supplied, is 10.

     Applicative `string->number' returns the best approximation of the
     number represented by `string'.  If `string' is not a valid
     representation of a number in the given `radix' an error is
     signaled.

     Examples:
          (string->number "100") => 100
          (string->number "100" 16) => 256
          (string->number "#o100" 2) => 64
          (string->number "1.0") => 1.0

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: number->string (number->string number [radix])
     `radix' should be an exact integer, either 2, 8, 10, or 16.  The
     default `radix', if not supplied, is 10.

     Applicative `number->string' returns a string representing
     `number' in the given `radix'.  No radix prefix is present in the
     returned string.  If an inexact number is passed together with a
     radix other from 10, an error is signaled.

     The returned string is such that
          (string->number (number->string number radix) radix) == number

     Examples:
          (number->string 100) => "100"
          (number->string 256 16) => "100"
          (number->string 1.0) => "1.0"

15 Strings
**********

A string is an object that represent a sequence of characters (for now,
only ASCII is supported in klisp, in the future, full UNICODE will be
supported).  The external representation of strings consists of a
leading """, the characters of the string and a closing """.  Both
double quote and backslash should be escaped to appear withing strings.
Some other characters also have an escaped form for convenience.  All
of these are written with a leading slash ("\").  In klisp these are:
double quote ("\""), backslash ("\\"), null ("\0"), alarm ("\a"),
backspace ("\b"), tab ("\t"), newline ("\n"), return ("\r"), vertical
tab ("\v"), and formfeed ("\f").  You can also use inline hex escapes
to include arbitary unicode codepoints (only ASCII range supported for
now).  The syntax is "\x<hex codepoint>;".  New lines can be escaped to
simplify the accomodation of literal strings in source code, to do
this: use "\" followed by any ammount of intraline whitespace, a new
line and another ammount of intraline whitespace.  All of that intraline
whitespace and the newline, together with the leading slash is
discarded by the reader and doesn't end up in the string being read.

   A string has a length that is fixed at creation time, and as many
characters, indexed from `0' to `length-1'.

   Strings may be mutable or immutable.  If an attempt is made to
mutate an immutable string, an error is signaled.  Two immutable
strings are "eq?" iff they are "equal?".  Two mutable strings are "eq?"
if they were created by the same constructor call.  Two mutable strings
are "equal?" iff they are "string=?".  For now it is undefined if a
mutable and an immutable strings that are "string=?" are "equal?" or
not.  The only exception is the empty string.  There is only one empty
string (all empty strings are "eq?"  to each other) and it should be
considered immutable.  Even if an attempt is made to return a new empty
string (like calling `(string)', the canonical immutable empty string
is returned.  The string type is encapsulated.

   SOURCE NOTE: This section is still missing from the report.  The
features defined here were taken mostly from r7rs scheme.  It is
possible that in the future, klisp only admits immutable strings (like
lua and java), and that operations for contructing strings are moved to
a new type (like Java's StringBuilder/StringBuffer).  But for now,
compatibility with r7rs was preferred/simpler.

 -- Applicative: string? (string? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type string.  `string?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type string.

 -- Applicative: immutable-string? (immutable-string? objects)
 -- Applicative: mutable-string? (mutable-string? objects)
     The primitive type predicates for types immutable string and

     `objects' are of type immutable string or mutable string
     respectively.

     SOURCE NOTE: these aren't provided in the Kernel report, but added
     for convenience.  These can be implemented in standard kernel by
     using guards.

 -- Applicative: string<? (string<? . strings)
 -- Applicative: string<=? (string<=? . strings)

     These predicates convert the strings to lowercase and then compare
     them using their lexicographic order.

 -- Applicative: make-string (make-string k [char])
     Applicative `make-string' constructs and returns a new mutable
     string of length `k'.  If `char' is specified, then all characters
     in the returned string are `char', otherwise the content of the
     string is unspecified.

 -- Applicative: string (string . chars)
     Applicative `string' contructs and return a new mutable string
     composed of the character arguments.

 -- Applicative: string-length (string-length string)
     Applicative `string-length' returns the length of `string'.

 -- Applicative: string-ref (string-ref string k)
     Applicative `string-ref' returns the character of `string' at
     position `k'.  If `k' is out of bounds (i.e. less than `0' or
     greater or equal than `(length string)') an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: string-set! (string-set! string k char)
     Applicative `string-set!' replaces the character with index `k' in
     `string' with character `char'.  If `k' is out of bounds, or
     `string' is immutable, an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: string-fill! (string-fill! string char)
     Applicative `string-fill!' replaces all the characters in `string'
     with character `char'.  If `string' is an immutable string, an
     error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: substring (substring string k1 k2)
     Both `k1' & `k2' should be valid indexes in `string'.  Also it
     should be the case that `k1 <= k2'.

     Applicative `substring' constructs and returns a new immutable
     string with length `k2 - k1', with the characters from `string',
     starting at index `k1' (inclusive) and ending at index `k2'
     (exclusive).

 -- Applicative: string-downcase (string-downcase string)
 -- Applicative: string-titlecase (string-titlecase string)
 -- Applicative: string-foldcase (string-foldcase string)
     These applicatives perform the respective case folding on the
     passed `string' and return a new mutable strings as a result.  The
     original `string' is not modified.  For now in klisp only ASCII is
     implemented, and so `string-foldcase' is the same as
     `string-downcase'.

16 Characters
*************

A character is an object that represents an ASCII character (for now,
only ASCII is supported in klisp, in the future, full UNICODE will be
supported).

   The external representation of characters consists of a leading "#\"
and the character or character name or "#\x" followed by the hex
unicode code point (only ASCII supported for now).  The supported names
for now are "null", "alarm", "backspace", "tab", "newline", "return",
"escape", "space", "delete", "vtab", and "formfeed" (this is a
combination of the ones accepted in r6rs and r7rs).

   Characters are immutable.  The character type is encapsulated.

   SOURCE NOTE: This section is still missing from the report.  The
features defined here were taken mostly from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: char? (char? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type character.  `char?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type character.

 -- Applicative: char=? (char=? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char<? (char<? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char<=? (char<=? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char>? (char>? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char>=? (char>=? . chars)
     These predicates compare any number of characters using their
     ASCII value for the comparison.

 -- Applicative: char-ci=? (char-ci=? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-ci<? (char-ci<? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-ci<=? (char-ci<=? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-ci>? (char-ci>? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-ci>=? (char-ci>=? . chars)
     These predicates convert the chars to lowercase and then compare
     their ASCII values.

 -- Applicative: char-alphabetic? (char-alphabetic? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-numeric? (char-numeric? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-whitespace? (char-whitespace? . chars)
     These predicates return true iff all of their arguments are
     respectively "alphabetic", "numeric", or "whitespace".

 -- Applicative: char-upper-case? (char-upper-case? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-lower-case? (char-lower-case? . chars)
 -- Applicative: char-title-case? (char-title-case? . chars)
     These predicates return true iff all of their arguments are
     respectively "upper case, "lower case", or "title case".

     Currently klisp only supports ASCII, so there are no title-cased
     characters (i.e. `char-title-case?' always returns false).

 -- Applicative: char-upcase (char-upcase char)
 -- Applicative: char-downcase (char-downcase char)
 -- Applicative: char-titlecase (char-downcase char)
 -- Applicative: char-foldcase (char-downcase char)
     These applicatives return a character `char2' so that:
          (char-ci=? char char2) => #t

     If `char' is alphabetic then the following holds:

          (char-upper-case? (char-upcase char)) => #t
          (char-lower-case? (char-downcase char)) => #t

     Currently klisp only supports ASCII, so `char-foldcase' behaves as
     `char-downcase' and `char-titlecase' behaves as `char-upcase'.

 -- Applicative: char->integer (char->integer char)
 -- Applicative: integer->char (integer->char k)
     These applicatives convert between ASCII values (as exact integers
     between 0 and 127) and characters.  If an integer that is out of
     range for ASCII characters is passed to `integer->char', an error
     is signaled.

 -- Applicative: char-digit? (char-digit? char [base])
     `base' must be an exact integer, between 2 and 36, it omitted it
     defaults to `10'.

     Applicative `char-digit?' is a predicate that returns true iff
     `char' is a digit in base `base'.  If `base' is greater than 10,
     then either upper case or lower case letters can be used.

     SOURCE NOTE:  This is like char-numeric? but with bases other than
     10.

 -- Applicative: char->digit (char->digit char [base])
 -- Applicative: digit->char (digit->char digit [base])
     `base' must be an exact integer, between 2 and 36, it omitted it
     defaults to `10'.  In `char->digit', `char' should be a character
     such that
          (char-digit? char base) => #t
     In `digit->char', `digit' should be an exact integer such that
          (>=? (- base 1) digit 0) => #t

     These two applicatives convert between chars representing digits
     and the corresponding integer values, in arbitrary bases (between
     2 and 36).

     `char->digit' accepts either lower or upper case characters (if
     the base is greater than 10), `digit->char' always returns lower
     characters (or numbers of course).

     SOURCE NOTE: These are like r7rs digit-value but augmented with a
     base argument.

17 Ports
********

A port is an object that mediates data from an input or to a
destination.  In the former case, the port is an input port, in the
latter case, an output port.  The data itself can consist of either
characters or bytes.  In the former case the port is a textual port and
in the latter case, a binary port.

   There are three textual ports open, binded by dynamic variables, one
for standard input, output, and error.

   Although ports are not considered immutable, none of the operations
on ports described in this section constitute mutation.  Ports are
`equal?' iff `eq?'.  The port type is encapsulated.

   An auxiliary data type used to signal the end of file was reached is
`eof'. The eof type consists of a single immutable value, having an
output only external representation (so that it can never be the normal
result of a call to read).  The eof type is encapsulated.

   SOURCE NOTE:  the eof type is not in the Kernel report, it is used in
klisp and was taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: port? (port? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type port.  `port?'  returns true
     iff all the objects in `objects' are of type port.

 -- Applicative: input-port? (input-port? . objects)
 -- Applicative: output-port? (output-port? . objects)
     Applicative `input-port?' is a predicate that returns true unless
     one or more of its arguments is not an input port.  Applicative
     `output-port?' is a predicate that returns true unless one or more
     of its arguments is not an output port.

     Every port must be admitted by at least one of these two
     predicates.

 -- Applicative: textual-port? (textual-port? . objects)
 -- Applicative: binary-port? (binary-port? . objects)
     Applicative `textual-port?' is a predicate that returns true
     unless one or more of its arguments is not a textual port.
     Applicative `binary-port?' is a predicate that returns true unless
     one or more of its arguments is not a binary port.

     Every port must be admitted by at least one of these two
     predicates.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: file-port? (file-port? . objects)
 -- Applicative: string-port? (string-port? . objects)
 -- Applicative: bytevector-port? (bytevector-port? . objects)
     These applictives are predicates that returns true unless one or
     more of its arguments is not a file, string or bytevector port,
     repectively.

     Every port in klisp is be admitted by exactly one of these
     predicates.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, but convenient in the
     face of the different port types admited by klisp.

 -- Applicative: port-open? (port-open? port)
     Applicative `port-open?' returns true iff `port' is still open.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: with-input-from-file (with-input-from-file string
          combiner)
 -- Applicative: with-output-to-file (with-output-to-file string
          combiner)
 -- Applicative: with-error-to-file (with-error-to-file string combiner)
     These three applicatives open the file named in `string' for
     textual input or output, an invoke the binder of either the
     input-port, the output-port or the error-port keyed dynamic
     variables respectively with the opened port & the passed
     `combiner' (this means that the combiner is called in a fresh,
     empty dynamic environment).  When/if the binder normally returns,
     the port is closed.  The result of the applicatives
     `with-input-from-file' and `with-output-from-file' is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: The first two are enumerated in the Kernel report but
     the text is still missing.  The third applicative is from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: get-current-input-port (get-current-input-port)
 -- Applicative: get-current-output-port (get-current-output-port)
 -- Applicative: get-current-error-port (get-current-error-port)
     These are the accessors for the input-port, output-port, and
     error-port keyed dynamic variables repectively.

     SOURCE NOTE: The first two are enumerated in the Kernel report but
     the text is still missing.  The third applicative is from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: open-input-file (open-input-file string)
 -- Applicative: open-binary-input-file (open-binary-input-file string)
     `string' should be the name/path for an existing file.

     Applicative `open-input-file' creates and returns a textual input
     port associated with the file represented with `string'.
     Applicative `open-binary-input-file' creates and returns a binary
     input port associated with the file represented with `string'.  In
     either case, if the file can't be opened (e.g. because it doesn't
     exists, or there's a permissions problem), an error is signaled.

     SOURCE NOTE: `open-input-file' is enumerated in the Kernel report
     but the text is still missing. `open-binary-input-file' is from
     r7rs.

 -- Applicative: open-output-file (open-output-file string)
 -- Applicative: open-binary-output-file (open-binary-output-file
          string)
     `string' should be the name/path for an existing file.

     Applicative `open-output-file' creates and returns a textual
     output port associated with the file represented with `string'.
     Applicative `open-binary-output-file' creates and returns a binary
     output port associated with the file represented with `string'.
     In either case, if the file can't be opened (e.g. if there's a
     permissions problem), an error is signaled.

     In klisp, for now, applicative `open-output-file' and
     `open-binary-output-file' truncate the file if it already exists,
     but that could change later (i.e. like in Scheme the behaviour
     should be considered unspecified).

     SOURCE NOTE: `open-output-file' is enumerated in the Kernel report
     but the text is still missing. `open-binary-output-file' is from
     r7rs.

 -- Applicative: open-input-string (open-output-string string)
 -- Applicative: open-input-bytevector (open-output-bytevector
          bytevector)
     These applicative return a fresh input port that reads characters
     or unsigned bytes from the passed sequence.

     SOURCE NOTE: These are taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: open-output-string (open-output-string)
     Applicative `open-output-string' returns a fresh textual output
     port that accumulates characters.  The accumulated data can be
     obtained via applicative `get-output-string'.

     SOURCE NOTE: This is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: open-output-bytevector (open-output-bytevector)
     Applicative `open-output-bytevector' returns a fresh binary output
     port that accumulates unsigned bytes.  The accumulated data can be
     obtained via applicative `get-output-bytevector'.

     SOURCE NOTE: This is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: close-input-file (close-input-file input-port)
 -- Applicative: close-output-file (close-output-file output-port)
     These applicatives close the port argument, so that no more
     input/output may be performed on them, and the resources can be
     freed.  If the port was already closed these applicatives have no
     effect.

     The result returned by applicatives `close-input-file' and
     `close-output-file' is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is enumerated in the Kernel report but the text
     is still missing.  There's probably a name error here.  These
     should probably be called close-input-port & close-output-port.

 -- Applicative: close-input-port (close-input-port input-port)
 -- Applicative: close-output-port (close-output-port output-port)
 -- Applicative: close-port (close-port port)
     These applicatives close the port argument, so that no more
     input/output may be performed on them, and the resources can be
     freed.  If the port was already closed these applicatives have no
     effect.  If at some time klisp provided input/output ports these
     could be used to selectively close only one direction of the port.

     The result returned by applicatives `close-input-port',
     `close-output-port', and `close-port' is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is from r7rs. The equivalent `close-input-file'
     and `close-output-file' are probably name errors and only retained
     here till the draft standard rectifies them.

 -- Applicative: get-output-string (get-output-string port)
     `port' should be a string output port.

     Applicative `get-output-string' returns a freshly created mutable
     string representing the characters accumulated in `port' so far.
     `port' can be either open or closed.

     SOURCE NOTE: This is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: get-output-bytevector (get-output-bytevector port)
     `port' should be a bytevector output port.

     Applicative `get-output-bytevector' returns a freshly created
     mutable bytevector representing the unsigned bytes accumulated in
     `port' so far.  `port' can be either open or closed.

     SOURCE NOTE: This is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: read (read [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     input port.

     Applicative `read' reads & returns the next parseable object from
     the given port, or the `eof' if no objects remain.  If `read'
     finds and unparseable object in the port, an error is signaled.
     In that case, the remaining position in the port is unspecified.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is enumerated in the Kernel report but the text
     is still missing.

 -- Applicative: write (write object [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `output-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     output port.

     Applicative `write' writes an external representation of `object'
     to the specified port.  This may be an output-only representation
     that can't be read by applicative `read' in cases where the type
     of `object' doen't have a parseable external representation (e.g.
     combiners and environments).  The result returned by `write' is
     inert.  `write' is guaranteed to terminate even in the case of
     objects with shared or cyclic structure.  In those cases `write'
     will use special syntax to preserve sharing info.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is enumerated in the Kernel report but the text
     is still missing.

 -- Applicative: write-simple (write-simple object [port])
     Applicative `write-simple' is like `write' except that it doesn't
     write sharing info. It will hang if handed a cyclic structure.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: eof-object? (eof-object? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type eof.  `eof-object?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type eof.

     SOURCE NOTE: This is not in the report, the idea is from Scheme.
     The `eof-object?' name is also from Scheme, but this will probably
     be changed to just `eof?', for consistency with the other primitive
     type predicates.

 -- Applicative: newline (newline [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `output-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     output port.

     Applicative `newline' writes a newline to the specified port.  The
     result returned by `newline' is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from Scheme.

 -- Applicative: display (display object [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `output-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is not a textual output port, or is closed, an error is signaled.

     Applicative `display' behaves like `write' except that strings are
     not enclosed in double quotes and no character is escaped within
     those strings and character objects are output as if by
     `write-char' instead of `write'. The result returned by `display'
     is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from Scheme.

 -- Applicative: read-line (read-line [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed or if it is not a textual input port, an error is
     signaled.

     Applicative `read-line'

     SOURCE NOTE: this is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: flush-output-port (flush-output-port [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `output-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed or if it is not an output port, an error is signaled.

     Applicative `flush-output-port' flushes any buffered data in the
     output port to the underlying object (file, socket, pipe, memory
     sector, device, etc).  The result returned by `flush-output-port'
     is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: write-char (write-char char [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `output-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     output port.

     Applicative `write-char' writes the `char' character (not an
     external representation of the character) to the specified port.
     The result returned by `write-char' is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from Scheme.

 -- Applicative: read-char (read-char [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     input port.

     Applicative `read-char' reads and returns a character (not an
     external representation of a character) from the specified port,
     or an `eof' if the end of file was reached.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from Scheme.

 -- Applicative: peek-char (peek-char [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     input port.

     Applicative `peek-char' reads and returns a character (not an
     external representation of a character) from the specified port,
     or an `eof' if the end of file was reached.  The position of the
     port remains unchanged so that new call to `peek-char' or
     `read-char' on the same port return the same character.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from Scheme.

 -- Applicative: char-ready? (char-ready? [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a textual
     input port.

     Predicate `char-ready?' checks to see if a character is available
     in the specified port.  If it returns true, then a `read-char' or
     `peek-char' on that port is guaranteed not to block/hang.  For now
     in klisp this is hardcoded to `#t' because the code to do this is
     non-portable.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from Scheme.

 -- Applicative: write-u8 (write-u8 u8 [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `output-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a binary
     output port.

     Applicative `write-u8' writes the byte represented by the unsigned
     integer `u8', that should be between 0 and 255 inclusive, (not an
     external representation of byte) to the specified port.  The
     result returned by `write-u8' is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: read-u8 (read-u8 [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a binary input
     port.

     Applicative `read-u8' reads and returns a byte as an exact
     unsigned integer between 0 and 255 inclusive (not an external
     representation of a byte) from the specified port, or an `eof' if
     the end of file was reached.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: peek-u8 (peek-u8 [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a binary
     input port.

     Applicative `peek-u8' reads and returns a byte as an exact
     unsigned integer between 0 and 255 inclusive (not an external
     representation of a byte) from the specified port, or an `eof' if
     the end of file was reached.  The position of the port remains
     unchanged so that new call to `peek-u8' or `read-u8' on the same
     port return the same byte.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: u8-ready? (u8-ready? [port])
     If the `port' optional argument is not specified, then the value
     of the `input-port' keyed dynamic variable is used.  If the port
     is closed, an error is signaled.  The port should be a binary
     input port.

     Predicate `u8-ready?' checks to see if a byte is available in the
     specified port.  If it returns true, then a `read-u8' or `peek-u8'
     on that port is guaranteed not to block/hang.  For now in klisp
     this is hardcoded to `#t' because the code to do this is
     non-portable.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: call-with-input-file (call-with-input-file string
          combiner)
 -- Applicative: call-with-output-file (call-with-output-file string
          combiner)
     These applicatives open file named in `string' for textual
     input/output respectively and call their `combiner' argument in a
     fresh empty environment passing it as a sole operand the opened
     port.  When/if the combiner normally returns a value the port is
     closed and that value is returned as the result of the applicative.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is enumerated in the Kernel report but the text
     is still missing.

 -- Applicative: load (load string)
     Applicative `load' opens the file named `string' for textual
     input; reads immutable objects from the file until the end of the
     file is reached; evaluates those objects consecutively in the
     created environment.  The result from applicative `load' is inert.

     Notice that if `string' is a relative path it is looked in the
     current directory (whatever that means in your OS, normally the
     directory from which the interpreted was run or the directory where
     the interpreter executable lives).  klisp doesn't track the
     directory from which the current code was read, so there's in
     principle no way to load a file in the same directory as the
     currently executing code with a relative path.  See
     `find-required-filename' for a way to look for a file in a number
     of directories.

     SOURCE NOTE: load is enumerated in the Kernel report, but the
     description is not there yet.  This seems like a sane way to define
     it, taking the description of `get-module' that there is in the
     report.  The one detail that I think is still open, is whether to
     return `#inert' (as is the case with klisp currently) or rather
     return the value of the last evaluation.

 -- Applicative: require (require string)
     Applicative `require' looks for `string' following the algorithm
     described in applicative `find-required-filename'.  If an
     appropriate file can't be found, and error is signaled.  Otherwise,
     the file is opened for textual input; immutable objects are read
     and acumulated until the end of file is found; those objects are
     evaluated in a fresh standard environment; the results of
     evaluation are discarded and the result from applicative `require'
     is inert.

     Applicative `require' also register `string' (as via applicative
     `register-requirement!') so that subsequent calls to `require'
     with exactly the same `string' will not cause any search or
     evaluation.  The mechanism used for this can also be manipulated
     directly by the programmer via applicatives
     `registered-requirement?', `register-requirement!',
     `unregister-requirement!', and `find-required-filename'.

     Applicative `require' is useful to load klisp libraries.

     SOURCE NOTE: require is taken from lua and r7rs.

 -- Applicative: registered-requirement? (registered-requirement?
          string)
 -- Applicative: register-requirement! (register-requirement! string)
 -- Applicative: unregister-requirement! (unregister-requirement!
          string)
 -- Applicative: find-required-filename (find-required-filename string)
     `string' should be non-empty.

     These applicatives control the underlying facilities used by
     `require' to register already required files.  Predicate
     `registered-requirement?' returns true iff `string' is already
     registered.  `register-requirement!' marks `string' as registered
     (throws an error if it was already registered).
     `unregister-requirement!' marks `string' as not being registered
     (throws an error if it wasn't registered).
     `find-required-filename' looks for an appropriate file for
     `string' using the algorithm described below.

     filename search in controlled by environment variable
     `KLISP_PATH'.  This environment variable should be a list of
     templates separated with semicolons (";").  Each template is a
     string that may contain embedded question mark characters ("?") to
     be replaced with `string'.  After replacements, each template
     represents the path to a file.  All templates are probed in order,
     and the first to name an existing readable file is returned.  If no
     template corresponds to an existing readable file, an error is
     signaled.

     NOTE: in the future there will be some mechanism to alter the
     search algorithm dinamically, in the meantime this environment
     variable is the only way to customize it.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is not in Kernel, they are supplied per guideline
     G1b of the report (extensibility), so that klisp programs can
     easily duplicate the behaviour of `require'

 -- Applicative: get-module (get-module string [environment])
     Applicative `get-module' creates a fresh standard environment;
     opens the file named `string' for textual input; reads objects
     from the file until the end of the file is reached; evaluates those
     objects consecutively in the created environment; and, lastly,
     returns the created environment.  If the optional argument
     `environment' is specified, the freshly created standard
     environment is augmented, prior to evaluating read expressions, by
     binding symbol `module-parameters' to the `environment' argument.

18 Libraries
************

Libraries provide a way to organize klisp code with a clean & clear
interface to the rest of the program.  They are first class objects (as
all manipulable entities in Kernel, and according to the guidelines in
the Kernel report). A library has list of exported symbols and values
for those symbols (generally combiners but may be any object). The
library type is encapsulated.

   In addition there's a mechanism to refer to library objects by name
(where a name is actually a unique list of symbols and numbers), with
the ability to register new libraries, get the library object from a
name, unregister libraries, etc.

   These two ways of working with libraries conform the low level API to
libraries and are orthogonal to each other.  They are provided to allow
klisp programs to construct their own interface to library definition
and use, and to respect the guidelines and spirit of the Kernel Report.

   There's also a higher level API that is a combination of the lower
level APIs and behaves more like traditional module systems.  This is
probably what most klisp programs will use.  This API consist of the
`$provide-library!' operative to define (and register) new libraries
and the `$import-library!' operative to extract bindings out of
existing libraries.  This allows various forms of controlling which
bindings are extracted from the libraries and allows various forms of
renaming. It can be used both in the body of libraries or in the top
level.

   No association is made by klisp between source files and libraries.
For a possible mechanism to handle this see `require' in the ports
module. Also no special meaning is assigned to the library names.  This
could be used by an even higher level API, for example to map to
version numbers and/or to the underlying filesystem.

   SOURCE NOTE: This is mostly an adaptation from the r7rs draft of
scheme.  There's no mention of libraries in the Kernel Report, but they
were deemed important for klisp in order to share and distribute code
with a common interface.  A number of adaptations were made to the
scheme version to sit more comfortably with the Kernel way of doing
things (first class status, exposing of the library register, etc).

 -- Applicative: library? (library? . objects)
     The primitive type predicate for type library.  `library?' returns
     true iff all the objects in `objects' are of type library.

     NOTE: This is part of the low level API to libraries. It won't be
     needed to writers or users of libraries that stick to the higher
     level API (i.e. `$provide-library!' & `$import-library!').

 -- Applicative: make-library (make-library bindings)
     `bindings' should be an acyclic list of `(symbol . value)' pairs.
     Each symbol may only occur once in the list.

     Constructs a new library object with the passed `bindings' as
     exported objects.

     NOTE: This is part of the low level API to libraries, writers of
     libraries are encouraged to use `$provide-library!' to define
     their libraries.

 -- Applicative: get-library-export-list (get-library-export-list
          library)
 -- Applicative: get-library-environment (get-library-environment
          library)
     `get-library-export-list' returns the list of symbols exported
     from the passed library.  `get-library-environment' returns a
     fresh empty environment whose parent has all exported symbols of
     the library bound to the exported objects.

     NOTE: This is part of the low level API to libraries, users of
     libraries are encouraged to use `$import-library!' to get bindings
     out of libraries (and into the current environment).

 -- Operative: $registered-library? ($registered-library? name)
 -- Operative: $get-registered-library ($get-registered-library name)
 -- Operative: $register-library! ($register-library! name library)
 -- Operative: $unregister-library! ($unregister-library! name)
     `name' should a an acyclic list of symbols and exact non-negative
     integers.  Two registered libraries can't have the same name (in
     the sense of `equal?').

     These operatives control the library registry that maps names to
     libraries.

     Predicate `$registered-library?' returns true iff a library named
     `name' is already registered.  `get-registered-library' returns
     the library object associated with `name' (or throws an error if
     no library named `name' is registered).  `$register-library!'
     registers `library' with name `name' (throws an error if `name' is
     already registered.  `$unregister-library!' removes the library
     registered as `name' from the library register (throws an error if
     no such library was registered).

     NOTE: This is part of the low level API to libraries, users &
     writers of libraries are encouraged to use `$provide-library!' to
     create & register new libraries.

 -- Operative: $provide-library! ($provide-library! name exports . body)
 -- Operative: $import-library! ($import-library! . imports)
     `name' should be as for `register-library!' and not already
     registered.  `exports' should be a list of `(#:export
     <export-spec> ...)'. Where `<export spec>' is either:
        * `symbol'

        * `(#:rename internal-symbol external-symbol)'

     A lone symbol has the same semantics as the pair with that symbol
     in both internal and external positions.  No symbol can appear
     more than once as external.  `body' should be an acyclic list of
     expressions.  `exports' should be a list like `(<import-spec>
     ...)' where `<import-spec>' is either
        * `<name>'

        * `(#:only <import-spec> symbol ...)'

        * `(#:except <import-spec> symbol ...)'

        * `(#:prefix <import-spec> symbol)'

        * `(#:rename <import-spec> (orig-symbol new-symbol) ...)'

     These two operatives conform the higher level API for klisp
     libraries.  They are what most users of klisp (both writers and
     users of libraries) will use.

     Operative `$provide-library!' creates and register a library with
     name `name' and exported symbols obtained from the `exports' list
     and values prepared by the `body'.  First a child of the dynamic
     environment is created.  Then, `body' is evaluated sequentially as
     if by `$sequence' in that environment.  Next a new library is
     created with a list of exported bindings that use the external
     symbols in `exports' as names and the values bound by the
     corresponding internal symbols in the created environment, as
     values.  If a lone symbol is used in `exports' it is used both as
     internal and external symbol for that binding.  Lastly, the new
     library object is registered as `name'.  This mechanism more or
     less follows the idea of operative `$provide!' from the Kernel
     Report, but it also allows for renaming.

     Operative `$import-library!' imports to the current environment
     any combination of bindings from any number of named libraries,
     while allowing renaming of said bindings.  It can be used in any
     context, as any other Kernel expression.  `$import-library!' looks
     for the named libraries and then extracts & renames the specified
     bindings according to each `<import-spec>' and defines them (in
     the sense of `$define!'  and `$set!') in the current dynamic
     environment.  The set of bindings to import are generated in a
     recursive manner.  This allows a great deal of control of the
     imported bindings and their names.  The semantics for the set of
     bindings generated by the various `<import-spec>'s are as follows:
        * `<name>': All bindings from library `name'.

        * `(#:only <import-spec> symbol ...)': Only the named bindings
          from the set of bindings in `<import-spec>'.

        * `(#:except <import-spec> symbol ...)': All bindings from the
          set in `<import-spec>' except those named in the list.

        * `(#:prefix <import-spec> symbol)': All bindings from the set
          in `<import-spec>' but renamed by prefixing each one with the
          specified prefix `symbol'.

        * `(#:rename <import-spec> (orig-symbol new-symbol) ...)': All
          bindings from the set in `<import-spec>' but renaming all
          `orig-symbol' to the corresponding `new-symbol'.

     If two values are tried to be imported with the same name, they are
     checked for `eq?'-ness, if they are deemed `eq?' to each other
     they are imported, otherwise `$import-library!' throws an error.
     This helps catch name collisions while allowing to reexport
     bindings from used libraries without conflict.

19 System
*********

Module System contains some useful features for interacting with the
host environment.

   SOURCE NOTE: most of these come from r7rs.

 -- Applicative: get-current-second (get-current-second)
     Applicative `get-current-second' returns the number of seconds
     elapsed since the UNIX/POSIX epoch (that is midnight January 1st,
     1970, UTC).

     NOTE: r7rs specifies TAI seconds, but for now we are sticking to
     POSIX here.

 -- Applicative: get-current-jiffies (get-current-jiffies)
     Applicative `get-current-jiffies' returns the number of jiffies
     (fractions of a second) elapsed since an arbitrary epoch that may
     change in each run of the klisp interpreter.  Applicative
     `get-jiffies-per-second' can be used to determine which fraction
     of a second a jiffy represents.

 -- Applicative: get-jiffies-per-second (get-jiffies-per-second)
     Applicative `get-jiffies-per-second' returns a constant
     representing the number of jiffies that correspond to one second.

 -- Applicative: file-exists (file-exists string)
     Predicate `file-exists?' checks to see if a file named `string'
     exists.

 -- Applicative: delete-file (delete-file string)
     `string' should be the name/path for an existing file.

     Applicative `delete-file' deletes the file named `string'.  If it
     doesn't exists or can't be deleted, an error is signaled. The
     result returned by `delete-file' is inert.

 -- Applicative: rename-file (rename-file string1 string2)
     `string1' should be the name/path for an existing file, `string2'
     should be the name/path for a non existing file.

     Applicative `rename-file' renames the file named `string1' to
     `string2'. If the file doesn't exists or can't be renamed for any
     reason, an error is signaled. The result returned by `rename-file'
     is inert.

     SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from r7rs, it is taken from C, being
     quite similar to `delete-file'.

 -- Applicative: get-script-arguments (get-script-arguments)
 -- Applicative: get-interpreter-arguments (get-interpreter-arguments)
     These applicatives return respectively the script and interpreter
     arguments.  The script arguments are a list of the arguments
     passed to the klisp interpreter starting from (and including) the
     script name.  The interpreter arguments are the complete list of
     arguments passed to the klisp interpreter (including the name of
     the interpreter as the first item in the list, the interpreter
     flag arguments and the script name and arguments.

 -- Applicative: defined-environment-variable?
          (defined-environment-variable? string)
     Predicate `defined-environment-variable?' returns true iff
     `string' represents a defined envrionment variable.

 -- Applicative: get-environment-variable (get-environment-variable
          string)
     Applicative `get-environment-variable' returns the value of the
     environment variable represented by `string'.  If `string' doesn't
     represent a defined environment variable an error is signaled.

 -- Applicative: get-environment-variables (get-environment-variables)
     Applicative `get-environment-variable' returns an alist
     representing the defined environment variables and their values.
     The alist is a list of `(variable . value)' entries, where both
     `variable' and `value' are strings.
